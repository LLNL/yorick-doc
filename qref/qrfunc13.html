<h2>Generating Simple Meshes</h2>
<p>Many Yorick calculations begin by defining an array of <i>x </i>values
which will be used as the argument to functions of a single variable. The
easiest way to do this is with the <tt>span</tt> or <tt>spanl</tt> function:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;x = span(x_min, x_max, 200);</tt>
<br>This gives 200 points equally spaced from <tt>x_min</tt> to <tt>x_max</tt>.
</p>
<p>A two dimensional rectangular grid is most easily obtained as follows:
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;x = span(x_min, x_max, 50)(, -:1:40);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;y = span(y_min, y_max, 40)(-:1:50, );</tt>
<br>This gives a 50-by-40 rectangular grid with <tt>x</tt> varying fastest.
Such a grid is appropriate for exploring the behavior of a function of
two variables. Higher dimensional meshes can be built in this way, too.
