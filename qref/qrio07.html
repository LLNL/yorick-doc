<h2>Writing History Records</h2>
<p>To write a family of files containing history records:
</p>
<ol type=1>
<li>Create the file using <tt>createb</tt>.</li>
<li>Write all of the non-record (time independent) variables to the file
using <tt>save</tt>.</li>
<li>Create a record which will correspond to time <i>time</i> and cycle
<i>ncyc</i>
for future <tt>jt</tt> and <tt>jc</tt> commands. Use:
<br><tt>&nbsp;add_record, <i>f, time, ncyc</i>&nbsp;</tt> make new record at <i>time,
ncyc</i></li>
<li>Write all record (time dependent) variables to the file using
<tt>save</tt>.
After the first <tt>add_record</tt>, <tt>save</tt> will create and store
record variables instead of non-record variables as in step 2.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each new record you wish to add to the file.
For the second and subsequent records, <tt>save</tt> will not allow variables
which were not written to the first record, or whose data type or shape
has changed since the first record. That is, the structure of all history
records in a file must be identical. Use type <tt>pointer</tt> variables
to deal with data which changes in size, shape, or data type.</li>
</ol>
<p>After each <tt>add_record</tt>, any number of <tt>save</tt> commands
may be used to write the record.
</p>
<p>If the current member of a history record file family has at least one
record, and if the next record would cause the file to exceed the maximum
allowed file size, <tt>add_record</tt> will automatically form the next
member of the family. The maximum family member file size defaults to 4
MBytes, but:
</p>
<p><tt>set_filesize, <i>f, n_bytes</i>&nbsp;</tt> set family member size
</p>
