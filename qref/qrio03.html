<h2>Positioning a Text File</h2>
<p>The <tt>write</tt> function always appends to the end of a file.
</p>
<p>A sequence of <tt>read</tt> operations may be intermixed with <tt>write</tt>
operations on the same file. The two types of operations do not interact.
</p>
<p>The <tt>read</tt> and <tt>rdline</tt> functions read the file in complete
lines; a file cannot be positioned in the middle of a line - although the
<tt>read</tt>
function may ignore a part of the last line read, subsequent <tt>read</tt>
operations will begin with the next full line. The following functions
allow the file to be reset to a previously read line.
</p>
<table><tbody>
<tr><td><tt>backup, <i>f</i></tt></td>
<td>back up file <i>f</i> one line</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><i>m</i> = bookmark(<i>f</i>)</tt></td>
<td>record position of file <i>f</i> in <i>m</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>backup, <i>f</i>, <i>m</i></tt></td>
<td>back up file <i>f</i> to <i>m</i></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The bookmark <i>m</i> records the current position of the file; it has
a distinct Yorick data type, and the <tt>info</tt> or <tt>print</tt> function
can be used to examine it. Without a bookmark, the <tt>backup</tt> function
can back up only a single line.
</p>
