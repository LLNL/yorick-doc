<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
<p>Yorick supports C-style logical AND and OR operators. Unlike the arithmetic
and comparison operators, these take only scalar operands and return a
scalar <tt>int</tt> result. Their precedence is between <tt>|</tt> and
<tt>=</tt>.
</p>
<p>The right operand is not evaluated at all if the value of the left operand
decides the result value; hence the left operand may be used to determine
whether the evaluation of the right operand would lead to an error.
</p>
<p><tt>&amp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt> logical and (scalar <tt>int</tt> result)&nbsp;
<br><tt>||&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt> logical or (scalar <tt>int</tt> result)
</p>
<p>The logical NOT operator takes an array or a scalar operand, returning
<tt>int</tt>
1 if the operand was zero, 0 otherwise. Its precedence is above <tt>^</tt>.
</p>
<p><tt>!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt> logical not (<tt>int</tt> result)
</p>
<p>The ternary operator selects one of two values based on the value of
a scalar <i>condition</i>:
</p>
<p><i>condition</i> <tt>?</tt> <i>true_expr</i> <tt>:</tt> <i>false_expr</i>
</p>
<p>Its precedence is low, and it must be parenthesized in a function argument
list or an array index list to prevent confusion with the <tt>:</tt> in
the index range syntax. Like <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> and <tt>||</tt>, the expression
which is rejected is not evaluated at all.
</p>
