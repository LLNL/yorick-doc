<h2>Including Source Files</h2>
<p><tt>#include "<i>filename.i</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt> insert contents of <i>filename</i>
</p>
<p>This is a parser directive, NOT an executable statement. Yorick also
provides two forms of executable include statements:
</p>
<p><tt>include, "<i>filename.i</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt> parse contents of <i>filename.i</i>
<br><tt>require, "<i>filename.i</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt> parse <i>filename.i</i> if not
yet parsed
</p>
<p>The effect of the <tt>include</tt> function is not quite immediate,
since any tasks (<tt>*main*</tt> programs) generated cannot execute until
the task which called <tt>include</tt> finishes.
</p>
<p>The <tt>require</tt> function should be placed at the top of a file
which represents a package of Yorick routines that depends on functions
or variables defined in another package <i>filename.i</i>.
</p>
<p>The <i>filename.i </i>ends with a <tt>.i</tt> suffix by convention.
