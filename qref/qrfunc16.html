<h2>Reshaping Arrays</h2>
<p><tt>reshape, <i>x, type_name, dimlist</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt> masks shape of <i>x</i>
</p>
<p>Don't try to use this unless (1) you're an expert, and (2) you're desperate.
It is intended mainly for recovering from misfeatures of other programs,
although there are a few legitimate uses within Yorick. In case you want
to change the dimensions of an array but conserve the data use the following:
</p>
<p><tt>new=array(0.,dim1,dim2)</tt>
<br><tt>new(*)=old</tt>
</p>
<p>this copies the data of array <tt>old</tt> into array <tt>new</tt> but
preserves the dimensions of the array <tt>new</tt>.
</p>
