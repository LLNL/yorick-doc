<h2>Compound Statements</h2>
<p>Yorick statements end with a <tt>;</tt> or end-of-line if the resulting
statement would make sense.
</p>
<p>Several Yorick statements can be combined into a single compound statement
by enclosing them in curly braces:
&nbsp;<tt>{
</tt>&nbsp;<i>statement1
</i>&nbsp;<i>statement2
</i>&nbsp;...
&nbsp;<tt>}</tt>
The bodies of most loops and <tt>if</tt> statements are compound.
