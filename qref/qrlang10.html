<h2>Array Conformability Rules</h2>
<p>Operands may be arrays, in which case the operation is performed on
each element of the array(s) to produce an array result. Binary operands
need not have identical dimensions, but their dimensions must be <i>conformable</i>.
Two arrays are conformable if their first dimensions <i>match</i>, their
second dimensions <i>match</i>, their third dimensions <i>match</i>, and
so on up to the number of dimensions in the array with the fewer dimensions.
Two array dimensions <i>match </i>if either of the following conditions
is met:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the dimensions have the same length</li>
<li>one of the dimensions has unit length (1 element)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unit length or missing dimensions are broadcast (by copying the single
value) to the length of the corresponding dimension of the other operand.
The result of the operation has the number of dimensions of the higher
rank operand, and the length of each dimension is the longer of the lengths
in the two operands.
