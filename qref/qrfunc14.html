<h2>Using Pointers</h2>
<p>A scalar of type <tt>pointer</tt> points to a Yorick array of any data
type or dimensions. Unary <tt>&amp;</tt> returns a <tt>pointer</tt> to
its argument, which can be any array valued expression. Unary <tt>*</tt>
dereferences its argument, which must be a scalar of type
<tt>pointer</tt>,
returning the original array. A dereferenced pointer may itself be an array
of type <tt>pointer</tt>. The unary <tt>&amp;</tt> and
<tt>*</tt> bind
more tightly than any other Yorick operator except
<tt>.</tt> and <tt>-></tt>
(the member extraction operators), and array indexing <i>x </i><tt>(..)</tt>:
</p>
<p><tt>&amp;</tt><i>expr</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return a scalar <tt>pointer</tt> to <i>expr</i>
<br><tt>*</tt><i>expr</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dereference <i>expr</i>, a scalar pointer
</p>
<p>Since a <tt>pointer</tt> always points to a Yorick array, Yorick can
handle all necessary memory management. Dereference <tt>*</tt> or
<tt>-></tt>,
copy by assignment <tt>=</tt>, or compare to another pointer with <tt>==</tt>
or <tt>!=</tt> are the only legal operations on a <tt>pointer</tt>. A pointer
to a temporary <i>expr</i> makes sense and may be useful.
</p>
<p>The purpose of the <tt>pointer</tt> data type is to deal with several
related objects of different types or shapes, where the type or shape changes,
making <tt>struct</tt> inapplicable.
