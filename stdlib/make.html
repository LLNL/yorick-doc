  <pre>DOCUMENT make
      or make, path
      or make, path, template=1
      or make, path, template="Makefile_name"
 creates or updates the Makefile for a compiled package (plugin).
 If PATH is given, it is the directory containing the source code
 for the package; by default, PATH is ".", the current working
 directory.

 With the template= keyword, a template Makefile is written, which
 you can use as a starting point, filling in all the necessary
 information by hand.  In this case, make makes no further checks
 on the contents of the directory.  In the first form, the name of
 the Makefile template is "Makefile", but if the template= keyword
 is a string, that name is used instead.  The template Makefile
 will not function at all until you edit it.

 Alternatively, without the template= keyword, make looks at the
 contents of the directory, and fills in as much of the Makefile
 as it can using what it sees.  There are two cases:
 1. A Makefile (or makefile) already exists.  Provided the file
    contains a Y_MAKEDIR= line, make merely updates Y_MAKEDIR,
    Y_EXE, and Y_EXE_PKGS to reflect this running yorick, and
    attempts no other modifications of the existing Makefile.
 2. No such Makefile exists.  Then make writes a template Makefile,
    and reads all the .i interpreted source files, .c and .h C source
    files, and .f or .F or .m Fortran source files in the directory,
    filling in as much of the Makefile as possible.  In simple cases,
    the resulting Makefile will be perfectly adequate.  (If there
    is any Fortran source, however, it will never be adequate.)

 In case 2, the following steps are taken:
 A. Any .i files containing lines of the form
     plug_in, "pkname"
   or
     if (!is_void(plug_in)) plug_in, "pkgname"
   are identified as the "package include file(s)" which define
   the interpreted API for the package.  The make function takes
   the name of the package from the "pkgname" in these lines.
   At least one .i file must contain at least one plug_in line;
   at most one "pkgname" must occur in all the plug_in lines in
   all the .i files in the directory.  This information is used
   to fill in the PKG_NAME macro and the PKG_I macro in the
   Makefile (the latter becomes a list of every .i file containing
   a plug_in statement).
 B. All .c, .f, .F, or .m files are assumed to be required compiled
   source, and the OBJS macro in the Makefile is set to a list of
   all corresponding .o object files.
 C. If there are any .h C header files in the directory, every .c
   C source file is scanned for an include directive which reads
   the header.  An approriate dependency line for each .o file which
   is discovered to depend on local .h files in this manner.
 These steps will be sufficient to produce a finished Makefile in
 many simple cases; an example is given in the extend/ directory of
 the yorick distribution (a compiled complementary error function).

 These same steps will be attempted for C++ source code.  The gcc
 compiler recognizes the file extensions .cc, .cp, .cxx, .cpp, .c++,
 .C, and .CPP as C++ source code, and so does this make function.
 Similarly, .hh and .H are recognized as C++ header files, in addition
 to .h.  Microsoft Visual C++ recognizes only the .cpp and .cxx
 extensions, and several other popular Windows compilers recognize
 only .cpp (which is the extension used by Trolltech's Qt library).
 All of this is by way of warning you to be prepared for portability
 problems if you attempt to use C++.  The make function will emit
 rules for building C++ objects (cribbed from gmake); see the comments
 at that point in the Makefile if these don't work for you.  Be sure
 that any C++ compiled functions which will be called by yorick are
 declared as extern "C" in your C++ source.

 However, it is impossible for yorick to automatically discover
 complicated Makefile rules your package may require.  The most
 common example is dependency on a third party library, which
 requires a -l loader option, and very possibly a -L option as
 well.  You need to add these flags to PKG_DEPLIBS in the Makefile
 by hand.  If you want such a package to be buildable by non-experts,
 you will need to provide a configure script in order to fill in
 the required information across a wide variety of platforms.  This
 can be exceptionally challenging, which is why yorick itself has
 no dependencies beyond what is guaranteed to be present on every
 system where it can run (libc, libm, and, on Unix systems, libX11).

 Once the Makefile has been built it becomes part of the source code
 of your package, and should not be removed.  (You may want it to
 have an include directive to get the results of any configure script
 which must be run, however.)  Thereafter, use
   yorick -batch make.i
   (or simply make in a running yorick)
 to set Y_MAKEDIR, Y_EXE, and Y_EXE_PKGS appropriately for the
 particular platform where you are building (case 1 above).

 Read Y_HOME/Makepkg for a description of the various make targets
 available.  In a nutshell:
   make debug          builds a debugging version (never a plugin)
   make                builds a release version (a plugin if possible)
   make install        installs the release version (may require root)
   make install2       installs to relocate subdirectory
   make clean          removes all results, leaving only original source

  <pre>DOCUMENT write_home, dir
  writes file Y_HOME.txt to directory DIR (current working directory
  by default).  This file contains the path of Y_HOME, used by yorick
  to find its public installation when started as a private pacakge.</pre>
