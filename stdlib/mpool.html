  <pre>DOCUMENT pool_stats = mpool(fsow, fwork, freap)
  perform a pool-of-jobs parallel calculation, in which a master
  process farms out jobs to many slave processes.  The FSOW function
  defines one job, which mpool sends via MPI to an idle slave.  The
  slave calls the FWORK function to do the job, which mpool sends
  back to the master.  The master calls the FREAP function to assimilate
  the result of one job.  The whole cycle repeats until FSOW signals
  there are no more jobs.  The return value of mpool is a mpool_t struct
  instance containing statistics about the pool.

  The mpool function can be called in serial mode on rank 0, or in
  parallel mode on all participating ranks (by default that is all ranks).
  The FSOW, FWORK, and FREAP functions must conform to the following
  templates:
  func FSOW(njob, job_define_handle) {
    if (no_more_jobs) return 0;
    <compute parameters p1,p2,... for job number njob>
    vpack, job_define_handle, p1, p2, ...;
    return 1;
  }
  func FWORK(njob, job_define_handle, job_result_handle) {
    local p1, p2, ...;
    vunpack, job_define_handle, p1, p2, ...;
    <do job number njob defined by p1, p2, ...>
    <produce results r1, r2, ...>
    vpack, job_result_handle, r1, r2, ...;
  }
  func FREAP(njob, job_result_handle) {
    local r1, r2, ...;
    vunpack, job_result_handle, r1, r2, ...;
    <assimilate results r1,r2,... of job number njob>
  }

  Several keywords are accepted by mpool:
  use_vsave=1   if FSOW, FWORK, and FREAP use vsave instead of vpack
    and restore instead of vunpack.
  self=1        if the FWORK function should be called on the master
    process when all slaves are busy.  (This is usually not a good idea,
    because many slaves can become idle while the master is working.)
  list=[master_rank, slave_rank1, slave_rank2, ...]
    to specify a subset of processes to participate in the pool.  If mpool
    is called in serial mode, any processes not in list will be idle.  If
    mpool is called in parallel mode, the list= keyword must be identical
    in every participating process, but mpool will generate no message
    traffic outside the listed processes.  You can use this mechanism to
    permit FWORK functions to themselves call mpool.
    Without list=, rank 0 is the master and all other ranks are slaves.
  nmax=   do not use more than this many processes as slaves

  If tsow is the time to generate a job with FSOW, twork is the time to
  do a job with FWORK, and treap is the time to reap a job with FREAP,
  then mpool will employ twork/tsow slaves before the first slave finishes.
  In the long run, however, mpool can employ only twork/(tsow+treap) slaves
  in steady state, so unless treap is negligible compared to tsow, you risk
  starting more jobs than you can handle.  Since all slaves send messages
  back to the master, there is a serious risk that mpool will create a
  "denial of service attack" against the master process, if a large number
  of slaves is available.  By default, nmax=100, but even this may be too
  large, and you should consider carefully raising the limit.  You don't
  want more than a couple of dozen slaves whose job results are in the
  master's mp_recv queue waiting to be reaped.

  The return value of mpool is meaningful only on the master process.
  Among other things, it contains the following information:
    pool.njobs   total number of jobs done
    pool.nused   maximum number of slaves employed
    pool.navg    average number of slaves employed = twork/(tsow+treap)
    pool.nqmax   largest number of jobs in mp_recv queue
    pool.nignore  number of non-pool messages in mp_recv queue
    pool.nself   number of jobs done by master
    pool.tsow    total FSOW time [cpu,sys,wall] (help,timer)
    pool.twork   total FWORK time [cpu,sys,wall]
    pool.treap   total FREAP time [cpu,sys,wall]

  Algorithm:
    if no more jobs,
      if no slaves active, quit
      else block until message pending from slave
    if message pending from slave,
      reap pending, then sow next job to that slave
    else if nused<nmax
      sow to new slave, increment nused
    else if self work allowed
      sow to self, then reap from self
    else
      block until message pending from slave

  <pre>DOCUMENT pool_stats = mpool_test(fsow, fwork, freap)
  test FSOW, FWORK, and FREAP functions by conducting an mpool
  on a single processor in serial mode.  This can be run in ordinary
  serial yorick; it does not require mpy.  The mpool_test function
  accepts and uses the use_vsave= keyword.  The other mpool keywords
  are accepted but ignored.</pre>
