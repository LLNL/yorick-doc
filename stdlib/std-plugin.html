  <pre>DOCUMENT old_dirs = plug_dir(dirname)
      or plug_dir
      or current_dirs = plug_dir()
  causes plug_in to look in DIRNAME for dynamic library files, in
  addition to Y_HOME/lib.  DIRNAME may be an array of strings to
  search multiple directories.  The return value is the previous
  list of directories searched by plug_in.  No checks are made
  for repeats, so be careful not to grow the list indiscriminately.
  In the second form (or called as a subroutine with DIRNAME []),
  empties the plug_in search path; in the third form does not
  alter the current search path.  Note that Y_HOME/lib is omitted
  from the end of the return value, even though it is searched.</pre>

  <pre>DOCUMENT plug_in, "pkgname"

  Dynamically link to yorick package "pkgname".  The compiled
  functions of the package are in a shared object file; these
  files have a naming convention which differs slightly on different
  platforms.  On most UNIX systems (including Mac OS X), the
  binary file is named pkgname.so.  On MS Windows systems, the
  binary file is named pkgname.dll.  On HPUX systems, the name is
  pkgname.sl.  The "pkgname" argument to plug_in does not include
  this platform-dependent file extension, so that the yorick code
  containing the plug_in command will be portable.

  After dynamically linking the compiled routines in the pkgname
  shared object binary, yorick runs the function (which must be
  present) yk_pkgname in order to initialize the package.  At
  minimum yk_pkgname returns lists of the new compiled (builtin)
  functions defined by the package and the names by which they
  may be invoked by interpreted code.

  Additionally, yk_pkgname returns a list of files to be included
  containing interpreted wrapper functions for the compiled routines
  and DOCUMENT comments for the help system.  Conventionally, these
  include files are located in the Y_SITE/i0 or Y_HOME/lib directories,
  and the name (of one) of the file(s) is pkgname.i.  If the package
  has been statically linked (i.e.- not by plug_in), these .i files
  are automatically included when yorick starts.  However, if the
  package is loaded dynamically by plug_in, you must arrange to
  include one or all of these .i files as you would any interpreted
  package (e.g.- by the autoload or require functions, or manually).

  The upshot of all this is that the plug_in function is designed
  to be placed at the top of the .i files associated with the
  package.  You are not supposed to call plug_in manually, rather
  when you #include (or autoload) a .i file which needs compiled
  functions, that .i file invokes plug_in to perform any required
  dynamic linking to compiled code.  Thus, the end user does not
  do anything differently for a package that uses dynamically loaded
  compiled code, than for a purely interpreted package.

  Yorick dynamic library support solves a distribution problem.  For
  debugging and creating compiled packages for your own use, you want
  to build special versions of yorick with your compiled routines
  statically linked.  In order to support platforms on which there
  is no dynamic linking, if you call the plug_in function for a
  package that is statically linked (e.g.- plug_in,"yor"), the
  function will silently become a no-op when it notices that the
  "pkgname" package was already loaded at startup.
