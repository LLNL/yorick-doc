  <pre>DOCUMENT alm= accumulate(n, f, mesh, rcap, rtrack, pts, dylm, flux, nrpp)

  Do N batches (approximately rays_per_batch each, default 13000) of
  rays from file F, MESH = hydra_mesh(F), analyzing the symmetry of
  a capsule of radius RCAP (all rays tangent to this sphere),
  tracing the rays only down to radius RTRACK (>1.001*RCAP).

  This routine is designed to be called several times successively
  to get better statistics.  PTS, DYLM, FLUX, and NRPP are all updated.
  PTS = unit vectors in directions of points on capsule surface
        defaults to bucky(3,1): 1280 points with an intrinsic
        fidelity of about 1% out to l=12
        use bucky(4,1,domega), dylm= get_ylm(pts,lmax,list)*domega(-,..)
        to get 5120 points and intrinsic fidelity of about 0.2% at l=12
  DYLM = ylm*domega for PTS
  FLUX = accumulated flux at each of PTS; units are power/area
  NRPP = accumulated number of rays per point of capsule surface
  ALM = 91 coefficients of Ylm up to l=12 corresponding to FLUX
        l= [0, 1,1, 2,2,2, 3,3,3,3, 4,4,4,4,4, ...]
        m= [0, 0,1, 0,1,2, 0,1,2,3, 0,1,2,3,4, ...]</pre>

<div class="docblock"><a name="get_ylm"></a><h3>get_ylm</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT get_ylm(pts, lmax, list)
  returns values of Ylm at the 3-by-anything array of unit vectors
  PTS, for all l and m up to LMAX.  The return value is
  (lmax+1)*(lmax+2)/2-by-anything.  The LIST is also returned; its
  value is [1, 2,2, 3,3,3, 4,4,4,4, ..., LMAX+1,LMAX+1,...,LMAX+1]
  -- i copies of each integer i up to LMAX+1.  This can be useful
  in conjunction with the histogram function; its values are l+1
  for each element of the returned array's first index.  The m
  values are [0, 0,1, 0,1,2, 0,1,2,3, 0,1,2,3,4, ...].  Negative m
  values are omitted, since they would be the conjugates of m>0.
