  <pre>DOCUMENT rezone, filename
      or rezone

  Invoke the mouse-driven rezoner.  Input is taken from variables
  rt, zt, and ireg in the file FILENAME (which is prompted for if
  omitted).  Output is written to a different file as rt, zt, and
  ireg.  The output file also contains copies rez_rt, rez_zt, and
  rez_ireg in case the mesh under a different name is desirable,
  as well as rez_rt0, rez_zt0, and rez_ireg0, which are the original
  mesh.

  If you click on [Escape], you may continue rezoning where you left
  off by typing   rezone   with no arguments.

  When you are finished, click [OK] to write the output file.

  Use [Zoom or Pan] and [Set Styles] to change the plot limits or
  line colors and styles.  The [Zoom or Pan] screen has buttons which
  "warp" you to each bowtied or chevroned "problem" zone, as well as
  a button to toggle between rectangular and polar coordinates.

  Click [Drag Points] to drag points one at a time with the mouse.

  Click [Adjust Line] to smooth the points on logical line segments.
  You first click on the endpoints P and Q, then click a button to
  smooth or equal space the poionts between P and Q, or drag any
  point between P and Q to establish equal ratio zones ("ER" operation).

  Click [Adjust Region] to smooth the points in logically rectangular
  regions.  You first click on the opposite corners P and R of the
  rectangle PQRS, then click a button to smooth the interior points,
  or click on a point on one of the four edges to transfer the spacing
  on that edge throughout the region PQRS ("EQ" operation).

  The [Undo] (or [Redo]) button removes the effect of the most
  recent drag points, adjust line, or adjust region operation.

  Hints:
  (0) After [Escape], the current mesh is in the variables
      rez_zt, rez_rt, and rez_ireg.  You can change these
      variables "by hand" before restarting rezone to make
      algebraic adjustments.
  (1) Switch to polar coordinates during an [Adjust Line] or
      [Adjust Region] in order to get points to lie along a
      circular arc.  If your center point is not (0,0), you
      will need to [Escape] and subtract your center point
      from the rez_zt and rez_rt variables yourself, then
      [Escape] a second time to restore the proper coordinates
      before you write the output file.
  (2) You can select a center point as the second point during
      [Adjust Line] or [Adjust Region].  When you do this, the
      K (or L) value of this second point will be the same as
      that of the first point -- otherwise there is no way to
      distinguish among all of the logical points at the center.
      In an [Adjust Region], the center point will be labeled
      Q instead of R as usual, and you will need to choose a
      third point (S) to complete the rectangle PQRS.
  (3) If you set the variable rez_color=1 before you include
      rezone.i, you will get K lines and L lines drawn in different
      colors instead of the default (which is K lines dashdot and
      L lines solid).
  (4) If you have a color monitor, you can set rez_regs before
      invoking rezone in order to highlight a list of regions.

  The ALL keyword will be passed to the nbow function, which will
  not be called if the QUIET keyword is non-nil and non-zero.  By
  default, a short summary of bowtied and chevroned zones is printed.

  If you need help on how to use one of the screens, try getting
  help on the appropriate on of these see-also topics, e.g.-
     help, rez_style
  to get help on the [Set Styles] screen.

  is an optional hook function which is called after any change to the
  mesh (e.g.- by dragging points) has been made.  If it is defined, it
  may modify the external variables rez_rt and rez_zt.  This hook can
  be used, for example, to force points along some k or l line to lie
  along a symmetry line.</pre>

  Allow points in the rezone mesh to be dragged around with
  the mouse.  Press mouse button near a vertex, move mouse
  to desired position of that vertex, and release button.
  If the point where you click is less than twice the distance to the
  second closest point than to the nearest point, the point will not
  be moved (you will hear a beep when you release the button).
  Click on the [Undo] button to undo the previous move; you can undo
  up to 100 previous moves by successive [Undo] clicks.

<div class="docblock"><a name="rez_kstyle"></a><h3>rez_kstyle</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT rez_kstyle, rez_lstyle, rez_color
  is a vector of three longs:  [type,width,color]
  type MUST be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5,
  width MUST be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8,
  and color MUST be -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, or -10

  Either or both parameters may be set before or after including
  rez.i; by default:
    rez_kstyle= [4, 1, -2]    (dashdot, thin, foreground color)
    rez_lstyle= [1, 1, -2]    (solid, thin, foreground color)

  To distinguish K and L by color instead of type, try:
    rez_kstyle= [1, 1, -7]    (dashdot, thin, blue)
    rez_lstyle= [1, 1, -5]    (solid, thin, red)
  If the variable rez_color is true (non-nil and non-zero) when
  this file is included, then these will be the default.

<div class="docblock"><a name="rez_ladj"></a><h3>rez_ladj</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT rez_ladj
  Adjust the points along a logical line segment PQ:

  Click on [Set P] or [Set Q] to set the endpoints of the segment.
  When P and Q have been set, click [OK]; this button will
  read [Cancel] if P and Q do not have either the same K or the
  same L index.

  Click on [Smooth] to smooth the points along PQ.

  Click on [Equal Space] to make the points along PQ equally spaced.
  This forces PQ to be a straight line.

  Drag any point between P and Q to get equal ratio spacing of all
  the points between P and Q.  This also forces PQ to be a straight
  line; if PQ is initially curved, you may want to click on
  [Equal Space] before you attempt to drag points.

  Click on the [Undo] button to undo the previous adjustment; you can
  undo up to 20 previous adjustments by successive [Undo] clicks.

  When you are finished adjusting lines, click on [OK].

  Click on [Zoom or Pan] to change the plot limits (see rez_zoom).

  Click on [Set Styles] to change the line styles or colors (see
  rez_style).

  Hint:
      You can select a center point as the second point during
      rez_ladj.  When you do this, the K (or L) value of this second
      point will be the same as that of the first point --
      otherwise there is no way to distinguish among all of the
      logical points at the center.

  is a vector of region numbers which are to be drawn in the colors

  causes regions 3 and 5 to be drawn in colors.  All other regions have

  Change limits after setting rez_mesh.

  There are two modes of operation:
  (1) P-mode:
      Click on a point to magnify or demagnify about that point.
      Drag the point to move it to a different position in the
      viewport.  The left button zooms in (magnifies by 1.5), the
      right button zooms out (demagnifies by 1.5), and the middle
      button pans (no magnification change).  If you click just
      below or just above the tick marks, only the x coordinate
      is changed; clicking just to the left or just to the right
      of the viewport changes only the y coordinate.
  (2) R-mode:
      Left drag out a rectangle to set the limits to that rectangle.
      Right drag out a rectangle to cram the entire current viewport
      into that rectangle (an analog to zooming out).
      Middle drag to pan as in P-mode (the rubber band rectangle is
      meaningless in this case).

   Click the [R-mode] (or [P-mode]) button to change modes.

   Click the [OK] button when you are satisfied with the limits.

   Click the [Undo] button to remove the effect of the previous
   zoom-click.  Up to 100 successive undo operations are allowed.

   Click the [Polar] button to toggle polar coordinates.  The
   vertical axis will be theta, and the horizontal axis radius.
   The polar coordinate origin will be at (zt,rt) = (0,0).

   Click the [Next], [Prev], or [First] buttons to focus in on
   zones which are bowtied or chevroned.  These zones are marked
   by a B or a C, respectively (if rez_mark is set).
