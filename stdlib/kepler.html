  <pre>DOCUMENT jpl_planets
orbital elements from http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/elem_planets.html
"Mean orbit solutions from a 250 yr. least squares fit of the
DE200 planetarty ephemeris to a Keplerian orbit where each element
is allowed to vary linearly with time.  This solution fits the
terrestrial planets to 25" or better, but achieves only 600" for
Saturn.  Elements are referenced to mean ecliptic and equinox
of J2000 at the J2000 epoch (2451545.0 JD)."
J2000 = 2000 January 1.5

WARNING: these elements are 1.5 JD later than sch_planets

definitions:
argument of perihelion = longitude of perihelion -
                         longitude of ascending node
mean anomaly = mean longitude - longitude of perihelion

<div class="docblock"><a name="kepler"></a><h3>kepler</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT xyz = kepler(orbit, time)
      or xyz = kepler(orbit, time, ma, ta, norb)

  return 3-dimsof(orbit(1,..))-by-dimsof(time) XYZ coordinates
  corresponding to the orbit(s) ORBIT and time(s) TIME.  Optionally
  return mean anomaly MA, true anomaly TA, and integer number of
  orbits, each a dimsof(orbit(1,..))-by-dimsof(time) array.  The
  MA and TA are in radians.  The x-axis is along the line of the
  vernal equinox, the z-axis is ecliptic north.

  ORBIT has leading dimension 12: [angle from perihelion, mean daily
  motion, semi-major axis, d/dt(semi-major axis), eccentricity,
  d/dt(eccentricity), longitude of ascending node, d/dt(ascending
  node), angle from ascending node to perihelion, d/dt(perihelion),
  inclination, d/dt(inclination)]
  (Six pairs of a quantity and its time derivative.)
  The angles are in degrees; d/dt units must match TIME units.

  Mean anomaly is not an angle in real space; it is the quantity
  proportional to time in Kepler's equation.  True anomaly is the
  angle from perihelion to planet.

  With a non-nil, non-zero full= keyword, return XYZUVW -- that is,
  six coordinates including velocities as well as positions.

<div class="docblock"><a name="kepler2"></a><h3>kepler2</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT xyz = kepler2(orbit, xyz0)
      or xyz = kepler2(orbit, xyz0, time, ma, ta)

  return dimsof(xyz0) XYZ coordinates corresponding to the orbit(s)
  ORBIT and direction(s) XYZ0.  The dimensions of ORBIT beyond the
  first, if any, must match those of XYZ0, although XYZ0 may have
  any number of trailing dimensions.

  Optionally return TIME, mean anomaly MA, and true anomaly TA,
  each a dimsof(orbit(1,..))-by-dimsof(time) array.  The MA and TA
  are in radians.  The x-axis is along the line of the vernal
  equinox, the z-axis is ecliptic north.  The XYZ0 direction is first
  projected into the plane of the orbit; then XYZ will be proportional
  to XYZ0.  The time derivatives of the ORBIT elements are ignored.

  ORBIT has leading dimension 12: [angle from perihelion, mean daily
  motion, semi-major axis, d/dt(semi-major axis), eccentricity,
  d/dt(eccentricity), longitude of ascending node, d/dt(ascending
  node), angle from ascending node to perihelion, d/dt(perihelion),
  inclination, d/dt(inclination)]
  (Six pairs of a quantity and its time derivative.)
  The angles are in degrees; d/dt units must match TIME units.

  Mean anomaly is not an angle in real space; it is the quantity
  proportional to time in Kepler's equation.  True anomaly is the
  angle from perihelion to planet.

<div class="docblock"><a name="moon"></a><h3>moon</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT xyz = moon(time)
  return position XYZ of the moon relative to center of earth
  at TIME; the XYZ has leading dimension 3; x is along the vernal
  equinox, z is ecliptic north.  The corrections to the lunar orbit
  are from Schlyter (see sch_moon).  Claimed accurate to 2 arc minutes
  over some reasonable time.  TIME is in days since 0/Jan/00 (that is,
  0000 UT 31/Dec/99).  This is 1.5 days earlier than the J2000 epoch.</pre>

  <pre>DOCUMENT sch_planets, sch_moon
from "How to compute planetary positions",
by Paul Schlyter of Stockholm, Sweden
http://hotel04.ausys.se/pausch
"Please note that the orbital elements of Uranus and Neptune as given
here are somewhat less accurate.  They include a long period perturbation
between Uranus and Neptune.  The period of the perturbation is about
4200 years."
After corrections in the case of the moon, jupiter, saturn, and uranus,
these are claimed to be accurate to under 1 arc minute for the inner
planets, about 1 arc minute for the outer planets, and 2 arc minutes
for the moon.</pre>

<div class="docblock"><a name="solar_system"></a><h3>solar_system</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT xyz = moon(time)
  return position XYZ of the moon relative to center of earth
  at TIME; the XYZ has leading dimension 3; x is along the vernal
  equinox, z is ecliptic north.  Corrections due to Schlyter (see
  sch_planets) are applied.  Claimed accurate to under 1 arc minute
  over some reasonable time.  TIME is in days since 0/Jan/00 (that is,
  0000 UT 31/Dec/99).  This is 1.5 days earlier than the J2000 epoch.</pre>
