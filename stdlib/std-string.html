  <pre>DOCUMENT strcase(upper, string_array)
      or strcase, upper, string_array
  returns STRING_ARRAY with all strings converted to upper case
  if UPPER is non-zero.  If UPPER is zero, result is lower case.
  (For characters >=0x80, the case conversion assumes the ISO8859-1
   character set.)
  Called as a subroutine, strcase converts STRING_ARRAY in place.</pre>

<div class="docblock"><a name="strchar"></a><h3>strchar</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT strchar(string_array)
      or strchar(char_array)
  converts STRING_ARRAY to an array of characters, or CHAR_ARRAY
  to an array of strings.  The return value is always a 1D array,
  except in the second form if CHAR_ARRAY contains only a single
  string, the result will be a scalar string.  Each string is
  stored in sequence including its trailing '\0' character, with
  any string(0) elements treated as if they were "".  Going in
  the opposite direction, a '\0' before any non-'\0' characters
  produces string(0), so that "" can never be an element of
  the result, and if the final char (of the leading dimension)
  is not '\0', an implicit '\0' is assumed beyond the end of the
  input char array.  For example,
     strchar(["a","b","c"]) --> ['a','\0','b','\0','c','\0']
     strchar([['a','\0','b'],['c','\0','\0']]) --> ["a","b","c",string(0)]
  The string and pointer data types themselves also convert between
  string and char data, avoiding the quirks of strchar.</pre>

</div>
<div class="docblock"><a name="streplace"></a><h3>streplace</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT streplace(string_array, start_end, to_string)
  replaces the part(s) START_END of STRING_ARRAY by TO_STRING.
  The leading dimension of START_END must be a multiple of 2,
  while any trailing dimensions must be conformable with the
  dimensions of STRING_ARRAY.  The TO_STRING must be conformable
  with STRING_ARRAY if the leading dimension of START_END is 2.
  An element of START_END may represent "no match" (for example,
  when end<start), in which case streplace silently skips the
  replacement.  Note that when start==end, streplace functions
  as text insertion.

  However, if the leading dimension of START_END = 2*n > 2, then
  TO_STRING must have a leading dimension conformable with n
  (that is, of length either 1 or n).  In this case, streplace
  performs multiple replacements within each string.  In order
  for multiple replacements to be meaningful, the START_END
  must be disjoint and sorted, as returned by strfind or
  strgrep with a repeat count, or by strword.  In other words,
  the first dimension of START_END should be non-decreasing,
  except where end<start indicates no replacement.

  Invoked as a subroutine, streplace operates on STRING_ARRAY
  in place.

  Examples:
  s = "Hello, world!"
  streplace(s,[0,5], "Goodbye")
    -->  "Goodbye, world!"
  streplace(s,[0,5,7,7], ["Goodbye","cruel "])
    -->  "Goodbye, cruel world!"
  streplace(s,[0,5,7,7,12,13], ["Goodbye","cruel ","?"])
    -->  "Goodbye, cruel world?"
  streplace(s,[0,5,0,-1,12,13], ["Goodbye","cruel ","?"])
    -->  "Goodbye, world?"
  streplace([s,s],[0,5], ["Goodbye", "Good bye"])
    -->  ["Goodbye, world!", "Good bye, world!"]
  streplace([s,s],[0,5,7,7], [["Goodbye","cruel "], ["Good bye",""]])
    -->  ["Goodbye, cruel world!", "Good bye, world!"]

<div class="docblock"><a name="strfind"></a><h3>strfind</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT strfind(pat, string_array)
      or strfind(pat, string_array, off)
  finds pattern PAT in STRING_ARRAY.  Optional OFF is an integer
  array conformable with STRING_ARRAY or 0-origin offset(s) within
  the string(s) at which to begin the search(es).  The return value
  is a [start,end] offset pair specifying the beginning and end
  of the first match, or [len,-1] if none, with trailing dimensions
  the same as the dimensions of STRING_ARRAY.  This return value
  is suitable as an input to the strpart or streplace functions.

  The strfind function is the simpler string pattern matcher:
  strfind - just finds a literal pattern (possibly case insensitive)
  strgrep - matches a pattern containing complex regular expressions
  Additionally, the strglob function does filename wildcard matching.

  Keywords:
  n=  (default 1) returns list of first n matches, so leading
      dimension of result will be 2*n
  case=  (default 1) zero for case-insensitive search
  back=  (default 0) non-zero for backwards search
          If back!=0 and n>1, the last match is listed as the
          last start-end pair, so the output pairs still appear
          in increasing order, and the first few may be 0,-1
          to indicate no match.

  Examples:
  s = ["one two three", "four five six"]
  strfind("o",s)  -->  [[0,1], [1,2]]
  strfind(" t",s)  -->   [[3,5], [13,-1]]
  strfind(" t",s,n=2)  -->   [[3,5,7,9], [13,-1,13,-1]]
  strfind("e",s,n=2,back=1)  -->   [[11,12,12,13], [0,-1,8,9]]

<div class="docblock"><a name="strglob"></a><h3>strglob</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT strglob(pat, string_array)
      or strglob(pat, string_array, off)
  test if pattern PAT matches STRING_ARRAY.  Optional OFF is an integer
  array conformable with STRING_ARRAY or 0-origin offset(s) within
  the string(s) at which to begin the search(es).  The return value
  is an int with the same dimensions as STRING_ARRAY, 1 for a match,
  and 0 for no match.

  PAT can contain UNIX shell wildcard or "globbing" characters:
      matches any number of characters
  ?   matches any single character
  [abcd]  matches any single character in the list, which may
          contain ranges such as [a-z0-9A-Z]
  \c  matches the character c (useful for c= a special character)
      (note that this is "\\c" in a yorick string)

  The strglob function is mostly intended for matching lists of
  file names.  Note, in particular, that unlike strfind or strgrep,
  the entire string must match PAT.

  Keywords:
  case=  (default 1) zero for case-insensitive search
  path=  (default 0) 1 bit set means / must be matched by /
                     2 bit set means leading . must be matched by .
  esc=   (default 1) zero means \ is not treated as an escape

  The underlying compiled routine is based on the BSD fnmatch
  function, contributed by Guido van Rossum.

  Examples:
  return all files in current directory with .pdb extension:
    d=lsdir("."); d(where(strglob("*.pdb", d)));
  return all subdirectories of the form "hackNN", case insensitive:
    d=lsdir(".",1);
    d(where(strglob("hack[0-9][0-9]", d, case=0)));

<div class="docblock"><a name="strgrep"></a><h3>strgrep</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT strgrep(pat, string_array)
      or strgrep(pat, string_array, off)
 finds pattern PAT in STRING_ARRAY.  Optional OFF is an integer
 array conformable with STRING_ARRAY or 0-origin offset(s) within
 the string(s) at which to begin the search(es).  The return value
 is a [start,end] offset pair specifying the beginning and end
 of the first match, or [len,-1] if none, with trailing dimensions
 the same as the dimensions of STRING_ARRAY.  This return value
 is suitable as an input to the strpart or streplace functions.

 The underlying compiled routine is based on the regexp package
 written by Henry Spencer (copyright University of Toronto 1986),
 slightly modified for yorick.

 PAT is a regular expression, simliar to the UNIX grep utility.
 Every "regular expression" syntax is slightly different; here is
 the syntax supported by strgrep:

 The following characters in PAT have special meanings:

 '[' followed by any sequence of characters followed by ']' is a
     "range", which matches any single one of those characters
     '^' first means to match any character NOT one in the sequence
     '-' in such a sequence indicates a range of characters
       (e.g.- "[A-Za-z0-9_]" matches any alphanumeric character
        or underscore, while "[^A-Za-z0-9_]" matches anything else)
     to include ']' in the sequence, place it first,
     to include '-' in the sequence, place it first or last
       (or first after a leading '^' in either case)
     Note that the following special characters lose their special
     meanings inside a range.
 '.' matches any single character
 '^' matches the beginning of the string (but no characters)
 '$' matches the end of the string (but no characters)
     (that is, ^ and $ serve to anchor a search so that it will
      only find a match at the beginning or end of the string)
 '\' (that is, a single backslash, which can only be entered
      into a yorick string by a double backslash "\\")
     followed by any single character eliminates any special
     meaning for that character, for example "\\." matches
     period, rather than any single character (its special meaning)
 '(' followed by a regular expression followed by ')' matches the
     regular expression, creating a sub-pattern, which is a type
     of atom (see below)
 '|' means "or"; it separates branches in a regular expression
 '*' after an atom matches 0 or more matches of the atom
 '+' after an atom matches 1 or more matches of the atom
 '?' after an atom matches 0 or 1 matches of the atom

 The definitions of "atom", "branch", and "regular expression" are:

 A "regular expression" (which is what PAT is) consists of zero
 or more "branches" separated by '|'; it matches anything that
 matches one of the branches.

 A "branch" consists of zero or more "pieces", concatenated; it
 matches a match for the first followed by a match for the second,
 etc.

 A "piece" is an "atom", optionally followed by '*', '+', or '?';
 it matches the atom, or zero or more repetitions of the atom, as
 specified by the optional suffix.

 Finally, an "atom" is an ordinary single character, or a
 '\'-escaped single character (matching that character), or
 one of the special characters '.', '^', or '$', or a
 []-delimited range (matching any single character in the range),
 or a sub-pattern enclosed in () (matching the sub-pattern).

 A maximum of nine sub-patterns is allowed in PAT; these are
 numbered 1 through 9, in order of their opening '(' in PAT.

 This recursive definition of regular expressions often leads to
 ambiguities, both subtle and glaring.  Here is Henry Spencer's
 synopsis of how his routines behave:

 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 If a regular expression could match two different parts of the
 input string, it will match the one which begins earliest.  If both
 begin in the same place but match different lengths, or match the
 same length in different ways, life gets messier, as follows.

 In general, the possibilities in a list of branches are considered
 in left-to-right order, the possibilities for `*', `+', and `?' are
 considered longest-first, nested constructs are considered from the
 outermost in, and concatenated constructs are considered leftmost-
 first.  The match that will be chosen is the one that uses the
 earliest possibility in the first choice that has to be made.  If
 there is more than one choice, the next will be made in the same
 manner (earliest possibility) subject to the decision on the first
 choice.  And so forth.

 For example, `(ab|a)b*c' could match `abc' in one of two ways. The
 first choice is between `ab' and `a'; since `ab' is earlier, and
 does lead to a successful overall match, it is chosen. Since the
 `b' is already spoken for, the `b*' must match its last possibility
 -the empty string- since it must respect the earlier choice.

 In the particular case where no `|'s are present and there is only
 one `*', `+', or `?', the net effect is that the longest possible
 match will be chosen.  So `ab*', presented with `xabbbby', will
 match `abbbb'.  Note that if `ab*' is tried against `xabyabbbz', it
 will match `ab' just after `x', due to the begins-earliest rule.
 (In effect, the decision on where to start the match is the first
 choice to be made, hence subsequent choices must respect it even if
 this leads them to less-preferred alternatives.)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------

 When PAT contains parenthesized sub-patterns, strgrep returns
 the [start,end] of the entire match by default, but you can
 also get the [start,end] of any or all of the sub-patterns
 using the sub= keyword (see below).

 If PAT does not contain any regular expression constructs, you
 should use the strfind function instead of strgrep.  The strglob
 function, if appropriate, will also be faster than strgrep.

 Keywords:
 n=  (default 1) returns list of first n matches, so leading
     dimension of result will be 2*n
 sub=[n1,n2,...] is a list of the sub-pattern [start,end] pairs
     to be returned.  Thus 0 is the whole PAT, 1 is the first
     parenthesized sub-pattern, and so on.  The leading
     dimension of the result will be 2*numberof(sub)*n.  The
     sequence n1,n2,... must strictly increase: n1<n2<...
     The default is sub=0, which returns only the whole match.

 Examples:
 s = "Hello, world!"
 strgrep("(Hello|Goodbye), *([a-zA-Z]+)!", s)
   --> [0,13]
 strgrep("(Hello|Goodbye), *([a-z]*|[A-Z]*)!", s, sub=[1,2])
   --> [0,5,7,12]
 strgrep("(Hello|Goodbye), *([a-z]*|[A-Z]*)!", s, sub=[0,2])
   --> [0,13,7,12]
 strgrep("(Hello|Goodbye), *(([A-Z]*)|([a-z]*))!", s, sub=[0,2,3,4])
   --> [0,13,7,12,13,-1,7,12]

  <pre>DOCUMENT string

The yorick string datatype is a character string, e.g.- "Hello, world!".
Internally, strings are stored as 0-terminated sequences of characters,
which are 8-bit bytes, the same as the char datatype..

Like numeric datatypes, string behaves as a function to convert objects
to the string datatype.  There are only two interesting conversions:
  string(0) is the nil string, like a 0 pointer
    This is the only string which is "false" in an if test.
  string(pc) where pc is an array of type pointer where each pointer
    is either 0 or points to an array of type char, copies the chars
    into an array of strings, adding a trailing '\0' if necessary
  pointer(sa) where sa is an array of stringa is the inverse
    conversion, copying each string to an array of char (including the
    terminal '\0') and returning an array of pointers to them
The strchar() function may be a more convenient way to convert from
string to char and back.

Yorick provides the following means of manipulating string variables:

s+t         when s and t are strings, + means concatentation
            (this is not perfect nomenclature, since t+s != s+t)
s(,sum,..)  the sum index range concatentates along a dimension of
            an array of strings
sum(s)      concatenates all the strings in an array (in storage order)

strlen(s)          returns length(s) of string(s) s
strcase(upper, s)  converts s to upper or lower case
strchar(s_or_c)    converts between string and char arrays
                   (quick and dirty alternative to string<->pointer)
strpart(s, m:n)
strpart(s, sel)    extracts substrings (sel is a [start,end] list)
  string search functions:
strglob(pat, s)    shell-like wildcard pattern match, returns 0 or 1
strword(s, delim)  parses s into word(s), returns a sel
strfind(pat, s)    simple pattern match, returns a sel
strgrep(pat, s)    regular expression pattern match, returns a sel
streplace(s, sel, t)  replaces sel in s by t

strtrim trims leading and/or trailing blanks (based on strword)
strmatch is a wrapper for strfind that simply returns whether there
  was a match or not rather than its exact offset
strtok is a variant of strword that calls strpart in order to
  return the substrings rather than an sel index list

The strword, strfind, and strgrep functions produce a sel, that is,
a list of [start,end] offsets into an array of strings.
These sel indicate portions of a string to be operated on for the
strpart and streplace functions.

The sread, swrite, and print functions operate on or produce strings.
The rdline, rdfile, read, and write functions perform I/O on strings
to text files.</pre>

<div class="docblock"><a name="strlen"></a><h3>strlen</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT strlen(string_array)
  returns an long array with dimsof(STRING_ARRAY) containing the
  lengths of the strings.  Both string(0) and "" have length 0.</pre>

  <pre>DOCUMENT strmatch(string_array, pattern)
      or strmatch(string_array, pattern, case_fold)
      or strmatch(string_array, pattern, case_fold)
  returns an int array with dimsof(STRING_ARRAY) with 0 where
  PATTERN was not found in STRING_ARRAY and 1 where it was found.
  If CASE_FOLD is specified and non-0, the pattern match is
  insensitive to case, that is, an upper case letter will match
  the same lower case letter and vice-versa.
  (Consider using strfind directly.)</pre>

<div class="docblock"><a name="strpart"></a><h3>strpart</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT strpart(string_array, m:n)
      or strpart(string_array, start_end)
      or strpart, string_array, start_end
 returns another string array with the same dimensions as
 STRING_ARRAY which consists of characters M through N of
 the original strings.  M and N are 1-origin indices; if
 M is omitted, the default is 1; if N is omitted, the default
 is the end of the string.  If M or N is non-positive, it is
 interpreted as an index relative to the end of the string,
 with 0 being the last character, -1 next to last, etc.
 Finally, the returned string will be shorter than N-M+1
 characters if the original doesn't have an Mth or Nth
 character, with "" (note that this is otherwise impossible)
 if neither an Mth nor an Nth character exists.  A 0
 is returned for any string which was 0 on input.

 In the second form, START_END is an array of [start,end] indices.
 A single pair [start,end] is equivalent to the range start+1:end,
 that is, start is the index of the character immediately before
 the substring (which is to say start is the number of characters
 skipped at the beginning of the string).  If end<start, or if
 either start or end are <0 or >length, or if the original string
 is string(0), strpart returns string(0); otherwise, if end==start,
 strpart returns "".

 However, the START_END array may have any additional dimensions
 (beyond the leading dimension of length 2) which are conformable
 with the dimensions of the STRING_ARRAY.  The result will be a
 string array with dimensions dimsof(STRING_ARRAY,START_END(1,..)).
 Furthermore, the leading dimension of START_END may have any
 even length, say 2*n, in which case the leading dimension of
 the result will be n.  For example,
   strpart(a, [s1,e1,s2,e2,s3,e3,s4,e4])
 is equivalent to (or shorthand for)
   strpart(a(-,..), [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],[s3,e3],[s4,e4]])(1,..)

 In the third form, called a subroutine, strpart operates on
 STRING_ARRAY in place.  In this case START_END must have
 leading dimension of length 2, although it may have trailing
 dimensions as usual.

 Examples:
 strpart("Hello, world!", 4:6) --> "lo,"
 strpart("Hello, world!", [3,6]) --> "lo,"
   -it may help to think of [start,end] as the 0-origin offset
    of a "cursor" between the characters of the string
 strpart("Hello, world!", [3,3]) --> ""
 strpart("Hello, world!", [3,2]) --> string(0)
 strpart("Hello, world!", [3,20]) --> string(0)
 strpart("Hello, world!", [3,6,7,9]) --> ["lo,","wo"]
 strpart(["one","two"], [[1,2],[0,1]]) --> ["n","t"]
 strpart(["one","two"], [1,2,0,1]) --> [["n","o"],["w","t"]]

<div class="docblock"><a name="strtok"></a><h3>strtok</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT strtok(string_array, delim)
      or strtok(string_array)
      or strtok(string_array, delim, n)
  strips the first token off of each string in STRING_ARRAY.
  A token is delimited by any of the characters in the string
  DELIM.  If DELIM is blank, nil, or not given, the
  default DELIM is " \t\n" (blanks, tabs, or newlines).
  The result is a string array ts with dimensions
  2-by-dimsof(STRING_ARRAY); ts(1,) is the first token, and
  ts(2,) is the remainder of the string (the character which
  terminated the first token will be in neither of these parts).
  The ts(2,) part will be 0 (i.e.- the null string) if no more
  characters remain after ts(1,); the ts(1,) part will be 0 if
  no token was present.  A STRING_ARRAY element may be 0, in
  which case (0, 0) is returned for that element.

  With yorick-1.6, strtok has been extended to accept multiple
  delimiter sets DELIM for successive words, and a repeat count
  N for the final DELIM set.  The operation is the same as for
  strword, except that the N<=0 special cases are illegal, and
  if DELIM consists of only a single set, N=2 is the default
  rather than N=1.  The dimensions of the return value are thus
  min(2,numberof(DELIM)+N-1)-by-dimsof(STRING_ARRAY).

  <pre>DOCUMENT strtrim(string_array)
      or strtrim(string_array, which)
      or strtrim, string_array, which
  returns STRING without leading and/or trailing blanks.  WHICH=1
  means to trim leading blanks only, WHICH=2 trims trailing blanks
  only, while WHICH=3 (the default) trims both leading and trailing
  blanks.  Called as a subroutine, strtrim performs this operation
  in place.
  The blank= keyword, if present, is a list of characters to be
  considered "blanks".  Use blank=[lead_delim,trail_delim] to get
  different leading and trailing "blanks" definitions.  By default,
  blank=" \t\n".  (See strword for more about delim syntax.)</pre>

<div class="docblock"><a name="strword"></a><h3>strword</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT strword(string_array)
      or strword(string_array, delim)
      or strword(string_array, delim, n)
      or strword(string_array, off, delim, n)
  scans to the first character in STRING_ARRAY which is not in
  the DELIM list.  DELIM defaults to " \t\n", that is, whitespace.
  The return value is a [start,end] offset pair, with trailing
  dimensions matching the dimensions of the given STRING_ARRAY.
  Note that this return value is suitable for use in the strpart
  or streplace functions.

  If the first character of DELIM is "^", the sense is reversed;
  strword scans to the first character in DELIM.  (Except that
  if DELIM is the single character "^", it has its usual meaning.)
  Also, a "-" which is not the first (or second after "^") or last
  character of DELIM indicates a range of characters.  Finally,
  if DELIM is "" or string(0), the scan stops immediately, since
  the first character (no matter what it is) is not in DELIM.

  Furthermore, DELIM can be a list of delimiter sets, where each
  element of the list delimits a new word, so the return value will
  be [start1,end1, ..., startN,endN], where N=numberof(DELIM),
  and start1 is the offset of the first character not in DELIM(1),
  characters with offset between end1 and start2 are in DELIM(2),
  characters with offset between end2 and start3 are in DELIM(3),
  and so on.  If endM is the length of the string for some M<N,
  then all subsequent start,end pairs will be endM,-1.  Note that
  endN is always the length of the string.

  If N is specified, the final DELIM will be repeated N times, so
  the leading dimension of the result is 2*(numberof(DELIM)+N-1).
  Thus, instead of DELIM = [d1,d2,d3,d3,d3,d3,d3], you may specify
  DELIM = [d1,d2,d3] and N = 5.  (By default, N=1.)

  If OFF is supplied (it is distinguished from DELIM by the
  fact that DELIM is a string or [], while OFF is an integer),
  it represents the offset (0-origin character index) in
  STRING_ARRAY at which the word search is to begin.  (DELIM
  or N may be omitted to get their default values.)  The OFF
  may be a scalar or an array conformable with STRING_ARRAY.
  The returned offsets include OFF; you do not need to add OFF
  to the return value to get the offsets into STRING_ARRAY.

  The action of strword can be described as follows: If d1 is
  the first delimiter, d2 is the second delimiter, and so on,
  then the input element of STRING_ARRAY looks like this:
       d1 word1 d2 word2 d3 word3 d4 word4 ...
  The offset array returned by strword will select word1, word2,
  word3, etc., if used in strpart.  One defect of this system is
  that the final word has no trailing delimiter - it always
  extends to the end of the string.

  To remedy this defect, N<0 is interpreted as follows: It is
  the same as abs(N), except that the final [start,end] pair is
  supressed; that is, if you have specified N delimiters, only
  N-1 words will be returned.

  As a second special case, N=0 forces the final delimeter to be
  at the end of the string, rather than as soon after the previous
  endM as possible.  Like N<0, this reduces the number of start,end
  pairs by one.  (N=0 is useful, for example, in order to trim
  trailing blanks.)

  Examples:
  strword("  Hello, world!") --> [2,15]
  strword("Hello, world!") --> [0,13]
  strword("Hello, world!", , 2) --> [0,6,7,13]
  strword("Hello, world!", , -2) --> [0,6]
  strword("Hello, world!", ".!, \t\n", -2) --> [0,5]
  strword("Hello, world!", [string(0), ".!, \t\n"], 0) --> [0,12]
  strword("Hello, world!", "A-Za-z", 2) --> [5,7,12,13]
  strword("Hello, world!", "^A-Za-z", 2) --> [0,5,7,13]
  strword("Hello, world!", "^A-Za-z", 3) --> [0,5,7,12,13,-1]
  strword("  Hello, world!", [" \t\n",".!, \t\n"]) --> [2,7,9,15]
  strword("  Hello, world!", [" \t\n",".!, \t\n"], 2) --> [2,7,9,14,15,-1]
