<div class="docblock"><a name="fitpol"></a><h3>fitpol</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT yp= fitpol(y, x, xp)
      or yp= fitpol(y, x, xp, keep=1)
  is an interpolation routine similar to interp, except that fitpol
  returns the polynomial of degree numberof(X)-1 which passes through
  the given points (X,Y), evaluated at the requested points XP.

  The X must either increase or decrease monotonically.

  If the KEEP keyword is present and non-zero, the external variable
  yperr will contain a list of error estimates for the returned values
  yp on exit.

  The algorithm is taken from Numerical Recipes (Press, et. al.,
  Cambridge University Press, 1988); it is called Neville's algorithm.
  The rational function interpolator fitrat is better for "typical"
  functions.  The Yorick implementaion requires numberof(X)*numberof(XP)
  temporary arrays, so the X and Y arrays should be reasonably small.

<div class="docblock"><a name="fitrat"></a><h3>fitrat</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT yp= fitrat(y, x, xp)
      or yp= fitrat(y, x, xp, keep=1)
  is an interpolation routine similar to interp, except that fitpol
  returns the diagonal rational function of degree numberof(X)-1 which
  passes through the given points (X,Y), evaluated at the requested
  points XP.  (The numerator and denominator polynomials have equal
  degree, or the denominator has one larger degree.)

  The X must either increase or decrease monotonically.  Also, this
  algorithm works by recursion, fitting successively to consecutive
  pairs of points, then consecutive triples, and so forth.
  If there is a pole in any of these fits to subsets, the algorithm
  fails even though the rational function for the final fit is non-
  singular.  In particular, if any of the Y values is zero, the
  algorithm fails, and you should be very wary of lists for which
  Y changes sign.  Note that if numberof(X) is even, the rational
  function is Y-translation invariant, while numberof(X) odd generally
  results in a non-translatable fit (because it decays to y=0).

  If the KEEP keyword is present and non-zero, the external variable
  yperr will contain a list of error estimates for the returned values
  yp on exit.

  The algorithm is taken from Numerical Recipes (Press, et. al.,
  Cambridge University Press, 1988); it is called the Bulirsch-Stoer
  algorithm.  The Yorick implementaion requires numberof(X)*numberof(XP)
  temporary arrays, so the X and Y arrays should be reasonably small.
