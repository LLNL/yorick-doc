  <pre>DOCUMENT movie, draw_frame
      or movie, draw_frame, time_limit
      or movie, draw_frame, time_limit, min_interframe
  runs a movie based on the given DRAW_FRAME function.  The movie
  stops after a total elapsed time of TIME_LIMIT seconds, which
  defaults to 60 (one minute), or when the DRAW_FRAME function
  returns zero.

  func draw_frame(i)
  {
    // Input argument i is the frame number.
    // draw_frame should return non-zero if there are more
    // frames in this movie.  A zero return will stop the
    // movie.
    // draw_frame must NOT include any fma command if the
    // making_movie variable is set (movie sets this variable
    // before calling draw_frame)
  }

  If MIN_INTERFRAME is specified, a pauses will be added as
  necessary to slow down the movie.  MIN_INTERFRAME is a time
  in seconds (default 0).

  The keyword bracket_time= (again a time in seconds) can be
  used to adjust the duration of the pauses after the first
  and last frames.  It may also be a two element array [beg, end].
  If the pause at the end is greater than five seconds, you will
  be prompted to explain that hitting <RETURN> will abort the final
  pause.

  If every frame of your movie has the same limits, use the
  limits command to fix the limits before you call movie.

BUG:  If you hit <RETURN> to start a movie early, it will not
      pause at the end of the movie at all.  You probably should
      not use long initial pauses.
