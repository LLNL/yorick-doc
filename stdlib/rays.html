<div class="docblock"><a name="best_rays"></a><h3>best_rays</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT best_rays(rays)
  returns 5-element (x,y,z,theta,phi) representation of RAYS.
  The first dimension of RAYS may be length 3, 5, or 6 to represent
  the ray(s) in TDG/DIRT coordinates (x,y,theta), "best" coordinates
  (x,y,z,theta,phi), or internal coordinates (cos,sin,y,z,x,r),
  respectively.  The first dimension of the result always has length 5.

  The "best" coordinate system is the easiest to visualize:
  (x,y,z) represents any point on the ray, while (theta,phi)
  represents the ray direction in standard spherical coordinates
  relative to the +z-axis.  Namely, theta is the angle from the
  +z-direction to the ray direction (between 0 and pi), and phi is
  the counterclockwise angle from the +x-axis to the projection of
  the ray direction into the xy-plane, assuming xyz is a right-handed
  coordinate system.

  As a specification of a ray, this system is doubly redundant because
  the point (x,y,z) could be any point on the ray, and the underlying
  mesh through which the ray propagates is cylindrically symmetric about
  the z-axis.

  However, the slimits parameter -- used to specify the points along
  a ray where the transport integration starts and stops -- is
  measured from the point (x,y,z) specified as a part of the
  (x,y,z,theta,phi) ray coordinate.  Thus, any change in the point
  (x,y,z) on a ray must be accompanied by a corresponding change in
  the slimits for that ray.

<div class="docblock"><a name="dirt_rays"></a><h3>dirt_rays</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT dirt_rays(rays)
  returns 3-element (x,y,theta) representation of RAYS.
  The first dimension of RAYS may be length 3, 5, or 6 to represent
  the ray(s) in TDG/DIRT coordinates (x,y,theta), "best" coordinates
  (x,y,z,theta,phi), or internal coordinates (cos,sin,y,z,x,r),
  respectively.  The first dimension of the result always has length 3.

  The TDG/DIRT coordinate system is based on the coordinates (x,y)
  in a plane normal to the ray.  Unfortunately, the old TDG and DIRT
  codes used an angle theta which has the opposite sense from the
  "best" and internal coordinates.  Therefore, conversion from
  TDG/DIRT coordinates to internal coordinates will reverse the
  sign of theta.  Conversion from TDG/DIRT coordinates to "best"
  coordinates always results in positive theta, but the angle phi
  will be pi for positive input theta.

  The slimits parameter -- used to specify the points along
  a ray where the transport integration starts and stops -- is
  measured from the point of closest approach of the ray described
  by (x,y,theta) to the origin x=y=z=0.  Therefore, slimits is
  independent of the TDG/DIRT ray coordinate representation.

<div class="docblock"><a name="get_s0"></a><h3>get_s0</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT get_s0(rays)
  returns the s-coordinate of the point of closest approach of
  the RAYS to the origin x=y=z=0.  The length of the first dimension
  of RAYS may be either 3, 5, or 6; this first dimension will not
  be present in the result.

  The s-coordinate represents distance along the ray, increasing in
  the direction the ray moves.  The 5 and 6 component ray coordinates
  include a reference point (x,y,z) on the ray; s=0 at that point.
  For the 3 component ray coordinate, get_s0 always returns 0.

<div class="docblock"><a name="internal_rays"></a><h3>internal_rays</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT internal_rays(rays)
  returns 6-element (cos,sin,y,z,x,r) representation of RAYS.
  The first dimension of RAYS may be length 3, 5, or 6 to represent
  the ray(s) in TDG/DIRT coordinates (x,y,theta), "best" coordinates
  (x,y,z,theta,phi), or internal coordinates (cos,sin,y,z,x,r),
  respectively.  The first dimension of the result always has length 6.

  The internal coordinates are what Drat uses internally to
  describe the ray.  The coordinate system is rotated about the
  z-axis until the ray lies in a plane of constant y (there are at
  least two ways to do this).  The point (x,y,z) can be any point on
  the ray, and r=sqrt(x^2+y^2) is the corresponding cylindrical radius.
  The clockwise angle theta from the +z-axis to the ray direction
  (which always lies in the zx-plane) determines cos=cos(theta) and
  sin=sin(theta).

  As a specification of a ray, this system is triply redundant because
  the point (x,y,z) could be any point on the ray, both the sine and
  cosine of theta appear, and r=sqrt(x^2+y^2).

  However, the slimits parameter -- used to specify the points along
  a ray where the transport integration starts and stops -- is
  measured from the point (x,y,z) specified as a part of the
  (cos,sin,y,z,x,r) ray coordinate.  Thus, any change in the point
  (x,y,z) on a ray must be accompanied by a corresponding change in
  the slimits for that ray.

<div class="docblock"><a name="picture_rays"></a><h3>picture_rays</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT picture_rays(xpict, ypict, ray)
      or picture_rays(xpict, ypict, ray, theta_up, phi_up)
  returns 2-D array of rays, one at the center of each zone (which
  represents a pixel here) of the mesh (XPICT, YPICT).  The rays are
  all parallel to the given RAY (a 3, 5, or 6 element vector).  The
  (XPICT, YPICT) coordinates are in the plane perpendicular to the rays,
  with the origin XPICT=YPICT=0 at the given RAY.

  If (THETA_UP, PHI_UP) are given, the +YPICT-axis will lie along the
  projection of the (THETA_UP, PHI_UP) direction into the (XPICT, YPICT)
  plane.  The default (THETA_UP, PHI_UP) is (pi/2, pi/2) -- the +y-axis
  -- unless (THETA, PHI) is the y-axis, in which case it is (pi/2, 0)
  -- the +x-axis.  This matches the DIRT/TDG ray coordinate convention
  in the sense that if RAY is [0,0,theta], then
  (zncen(XPICT),zncen(YPICT)) are the DIRT/TDG (x,y) coordinates for
  the rays.

  If XPICT and YPICT are imax-by-jmax, the returned array will have
  dimensions 5-by-(imax-1)-by-(jmax-1).  That is, "best" coordinates
  are returned.  The (x,y,z) of all of the returned rays will lie in
  the plane perpendicular to the ray passing through the given central
  RAY.

  -- a point (x,y,z) on the ray, and the ray direction (theta,phi)
  relative to the z-axis.  The ray hyperbola is plotted with the
  z-axis horizontal.  The portion of the ray plotted is determined
  by the plray_lims command, which must be issued prior to the first
  plray.
