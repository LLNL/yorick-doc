  <pre>DOCUMENT lightwf, cmax
  Sets the cmax= parameter interactively, assuming the current
  3D display list contains the result of a previous plwf call.
  This changes the color of the brightest surface in the picture.
  The darkest surface color can be controlled using the ambient=
  keyword to light3.</pre>

  <pre>DOCUMENT plwf, z
      or plwf, z, y,x

  plots a 3-D wire frame of the given Z array, which must have the
  same dimensions as the mesh (X, Y).  If X and Y are not given, they
  default to the first and second indices of Z, respectively.
  The drawing order of the zones is determined by a simple "painter's
  algorithm", which works fairly well if the mesh is reasonably near
  rectilinear, but can fail even then if the viewpoint is chosen to
  produce extreme fisheye perspective effects.  Look at the resulting
  plot carefully to be sure the algorithm has correctly rendered the
  model in each case.

KEYWORDS: fill   -- optional colors to use (default is to make zones
                    have background color), same dimension options as
                    for z argument to plf function
          shade  -- set non-zero to compute shading from current
                    3D lighting sources
          edges  -- default is 1 (draw edges), but if you provide fill
                    colors, you may set to 0 to supress the edges
          ecolor, ewidth  -- color and width of edges
          cull   -- default is 1 (cull back surfaces), but if you want
                    to see the "underside" of the model, set to 0
          scale  -- by default, Z is scaled to "reasonable" maximum
                    and minimum values related to the scale of (X,Y).
                    This keyword alters the default scaling factor, in
                    the sense that scale=2.0 will produce twice the
                    Z-relief of the default scale=1.0.
          cmax   -- the ambient= keyword in light3 can be used to
                    control how dark the darkest surface is; use this
                    to control how light the lightest surface is
                    the lightwf routine can change this parameter
                    interactively
