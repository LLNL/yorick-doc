      or test1, npass
  Track a mock "ablation front" as it propagates through a mesh.
  If NPASS is given, the calculation is repeated that many
  times.  The zoning, densities, temperatures, pressures, and
  velocities are all computed arbitrarily, but the number of zones
  and groups are taken to be representative of a typical 1-D
  ablation calculation.</pre>
