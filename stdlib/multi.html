<div class="docblock"><a name="multic"></a><h3>multic</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT multic, mf
      or multic, [mf1, mf2, mf3, ...]
  closes a MultiFile created with multif.
  Presented with an array of multifiles, closes them all.</pre>

</div>
<div class="docblock"><a name="multif"></a><h3>multif</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT multif(mf)
  returns an ordinary file pointer for the MultiFile MF.
  Do not use close to close this pointer; just set it to [] when
  you are done.  Use multic to properly close the MF.</pre>

</div>
<div class="docblock"><a name="multio"></a><h3>multio</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT mf= multio(filename)
      or mf= multio(file)
  opens file FILENAME for use with the multi_streak function.
  The file MUST be subsequently closed using multic, since
  this function produces a hidden reference to the file.  The function
  multif can be used to return an ordinary file pointer, given the
  returned MF structure.  If the argument is already a stream FILE,
  that file will be used.  The call still produces a hidden copy of
  FILE, so you may set your copy of the FILE variable to [], but do
  not close the file.

  The following keywords can be used to allow for variations in the
  variable names or units, and to specify the correspondence between
  the zones in this file, and the zones in the master file:

  zonelist=index_list
  -or- zonelist=zonelist_name
    is an index list into the (rt,zt) mesh arrays of the master file.
    If ireg is the region number array (having the same dimensions as
    rt or zt, and with its first row and column all 0), and if FILENAME
    contains opacity data only for zones with region numbers 1 and 2,
    you could open the file using:
       mf= multio(filename, zonelist=where(ireg==1 | ireg==2))
    The zonelist should be nil only if the spatial dimensions of the
    opacity and emissivity in this file exactly match those of rt or
    zt in the master file.
    If zonelist is a string, it replaces the default name for the
    zonelist variable stored in the file (see multi_zonelist).

  zoneuse=index_list
    The zonelist specifies how the zones in this file correspond
    with those in the master file.  The zoneuse list allows you
    to specify that only some of the zones actually present in the
    opacity and emissivity arrays of this file are to contribute
    to the total.  This might be necessary to avoid double counting
    in a region covered by more than one file.  Hence zoneuse is
    a list of indices into the spatial dimension(s) of the opacity
    and emissivity arrays in this file.  If nil, all zones in this
    file will contribute.  If present, and if zonelist is supplied
    as an array (rather than out of the file), zonelist should
    have the same length as zoneuse.
    As a special case, if zoneuse is a scalar 0, no opacity or
    emissivity will come from this file; this makes sense only if
    this is the master file.

  opac=oname, emiss=ename, srcf=sname
    specify non-default names for the opacity, emissivity, and
    osource function arrays.  The defaults are given by the global
    variables mutli_opac, multi_emiss, and multi_srcf (see help).
    If the emissivity array is present in the file, it is preferred
    to the source function array, which will then be ignored.

  oscale=opacity_unit, escale=emissivity_unit
    are optional conversion factors to bring the units of the
    opac and emiss (or srcf) arrays into agreement among the various
    files which are to be used in a single run.  The default value
    is 1.0 (i.e.- all files are expected to have the same units).

  gb=gbname, gav=gavname, gexist=gexistname
  -or- gexist=group_existence_map
    specify non-default names for the group boundary, group energy,
    and group existence arrays.  The defaults are given by the global
    variables mutli_gb, multi_gav, and multi_gexist (see help).
    If the group boundary array is present in the file, it is preferred
    to the group energy array, which will then be ignored.  The file
    should specify group boundaries if its opacity and emissivity are
    averaged over finite width bins; group energies if its opacity
    and emissivity are computed at points.  The group existence map,
    if present, allows several disjoint spectral regions to exist in
    a single file.  If the data type of gexist is not "string", it
    should be an array of length one less than gb, if gb is present,
    or gav, otherwise.  By this means you can ignore spectral regions
    which are present in the file.

  gscale=photon_energy_unit
    is an optional conversion factor to bring the units of the
    gb (or gav) arrays into agreement among the various files
    which are to be used in a single run.  The default value
    is 1.0 (i.e.- all files are expected to have the same units).

  tscale=time_unit
    is an optional conversion factor to bring the units of the
    time into agreement among the various files which are to be used
    in a single run.  The default value is 1.0 (i.e.- all files are
    expected to have the same units).

  noextrap=1
    if present and non-zero prevents the opacity and emissivity
    data from this file from being extrapolated as 1/hnu^3 in
    master bins at energies above the highest energy bin in this
    file.

  freqfirst=0
    if present and non-zero means the frequency index is first
    for the opacity and emissivity arrays, instead of the
    default of frequency index last.

  <pre>DOCUMENT multi_gb, multi_gav, multi_gexist
  are the default names of the group boundary, group center, and group
  existence arrays in post-processing files.  By default, they are
  "gb", "gav", and "gexist".  If neither is present, drat_gb and
  drat_gav will also be tried.
  If present, gb is the photon bin boundary array, and gexist (if
  present) has one fewer element and is non-zero in bins which exist.
  Otherwise, gav is the photon energy array, and gexist (if present)
  has one fewer element and is zero between elements of gav which are
  not connected.  Isolated points in gav are removed entirely.
  Either gb or gav must be strictly increasing, and has units of
  photon energy.</pre>

  <pre>DOCUMENT multi_opac, multi_emiss, multi_srcf
  are the default names of the opacity, emissivity, and source function
  arrays in post-processing files.  By default, they are "opac",
  "emiss", and "srcf", respectively.  If none of these are present,
  drat_akap and drat_ekap will also be tried for the opacity and
  source function, respectively.  If emissivity is present, source
  function will be ignored.
  The units of opacity are inverse length, of emissivity power per
  photon energy per sterradian per volume, and source function
  power per photon energy per sterradian per area.</pre>

<div class="docblock"><a name="multi_streak"></a><h3>multi_streak</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT result= multi_streak(mf, rays, slimits, gb=common_bins)
  like the streak function, but allows opacity to be built up from
  "slave files", in addition to the "master file" MF(1).  The MF
  parameter is an array of MultiFiles, each created by multif.
  The master file MF(1) contains the mesh, and the master list of dump
  times.  Only dump times which are present in this master list, and
  in every slave file, will be processed.
  The master file MF(1) need not contain any opacity or emissivity data
  at all; each of the slave files MF(2:0) must contain data for at
  least one zone.

  The emissivities and opacities from each file are interpolated onto
  a common group structure.  This common group structure can be
  provided via the GB keyword to multi_streak.  If it is not provided,
  GB is computed by examining the group boundary (or center) arrays
  from the master and every slave file, and building a group structure
  which is at least as fine as every component group structure, at every
  point in the spectrum.

  Example:
    File family "prob_p00" contains the mesh and opacities and
    emissivities for all zones.  Family "pp_h00" contains post
    processed opacities and emissivities on a much finer spectral
    mesh, but only for zones in regions 1 and 2 of the original
    problem.  You want to transport the emission from the
    inner regions 1 and 2 through the overlying material:

      restore, openb("prob_p00"), ireg;
      master= multif("prob_p00", zoneuse=where(ireg>2));
      slave= multif("pp_h00", zonelist=where(ireg==1|ireg==2));

<div class="docblock"><a name="multi_streak_save"></a><h3>multi_streak_save</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT multi_streak_save, outname, mf, rays, slimits, gb=common_bins
      or multi_streak_save, outfile, mf, rays, slimits, gb=common_bins
  like the streak function, but allows opacity to be built up from
  "slave files", in addition to the "master file" MF(1) and 
  saves the streak in a PDB history file.  The MF parameter
  is an array of MultiFiles, each created by multif.
  The master file MF(1) contains the mesh, and the master list of dump
  times.  Only dump times which are present in this master list, and
  in every slave file, will be processed.
  The master file MF(1) need not contain any opacity or emissivity data
  at all; each of the slave files MF(2:0) must contain data for at
  least one zone.

  If the first argument is OUTFILE, a file variable instead of a
  file name, then that file is used for output.  You can create
  OUTFILE and add static variables to it with save (but do NOT call
  add_record) which streak_save otherwise wouldn't know about.

  The output file has history records at the same times as the
  input file.  Each record contains "time" (a double scalar),
  and the two arrays "transp", the transparency (between 0 and 1),
  and "selfem", the self emission (which has the same units as
  ekap in the file F).  The dimensions of transp and selfem
  are ngroup-by-2-by-nrays (where nrays represents zero or more
  dimensions, copied from the RAYS input array).  The RAYS and
  SLIMITS inputs are placed into the output file as non-record
  variables, and any variables in the drat_static option are
  copied form F to the output file.  The gb and gav variables
  are copied from F into the output file as well.  If the drat_glist
  option is present, that is stored in the output file also.

  The emissivities and opacities from each file are interpolated onto
  a common group structure.  This common group structure can be
  provided via the GB keyword to multi_streak.  If it is not provided,
  GB is computed by examining the group boundary (or center) arrays
  from the master and every slave file, and building a group structure
  which is at least as fine as every component group structure, at every
  point in the spectrum.

  Example:
    File family "prob_p00" contains the mesh and opacities and
    emissivities for all zones.  Family "pp_h00" contains post
    processed opacities and emissivities on a much finer spectral
    mesh, but only for zones in regions 1 and 2 of the original
    problem.  File "prob_strk" contains the streak history. 
    You want to transport the emission from the
    inner regions 1 and 2 through the overlying material:

      restore, openb("prob_p00"), ireg;
      master= multif("prob_p00", zoneuse=where(ireg>2));
      slave= multif("pp_h00", zonelist=where(ireg==1|ireg==2));
      fout= openb("prob_strk");
      save, fout, kmax, lmax;
      rays= ...
      slimits= ...
      drat_start= ...
      drat_stop= ...
      result= multi_streak_save(fout, [master,slave], rays, slimits);

  returns NFINAL+1 boundaries of NFINAL bins constructed by combining

  Use NFINAL=0 to get at least the resolution in the finest GBi in
  every region of the spectrum.

  This is done by constructing a total bin density function
  (#bins/energy width), as the maximum of the bin density of each
  component.  This total bin density function is integrated, and
  the integral is divided into NFINAL equal parts; the points in
  energy at which this division must be made are the returned bin
  boundaries.
