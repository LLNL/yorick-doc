  The bin boundaries are taken at the geometric means between
  consecutive gav(i), with the endpoints extended slightly beyond
  the endpoints of gav.</pre>

<div class="docblock"><a name="multi_bins"></a><h3>multi_bins</h3>

  <pre>DOCUMENT multi_gb, multi_gav, multi_gexist
  are the default names of the group boundary, group center, and group
  existence arrays in post-processing files.  By default, they are
  "gb", "gav", and "gexist".  If neither is present, drat_gb and
  drat_gav will also be tried.
  If present, gb is the photon bin boundary array, and gexist (if
  present) has one fewer element and is non-zero in bins which exist.
  Otherwise, gav is the photon energy array, and gexist (if present)
  has one fewer element and is zero between elements of gav which are
  not connected.  Isolated points in gav are removed entirely.
  Either gb or gav must be strictly increasing, and has units of
  photon energy.</pre>

  <pre>DOCUMENT gb= multi_line(nbins, hnu0, dhnu, dhnu_min)
  returns 2*NBINS+1 bin boundary energies for 2*NBINS bins
  cenetered around a spectral line at HNU0 of width DHNU.  The
  result begins at HNU0-DHNU and ends at HNU0+DHNU.  The finest
  two bins (nearest HNU0) has width DHNU_MIN, and the remaining
  bins have equal ratio widths as you move away from HNU0.</pre>

  to under a few megabytes.</pre>

<div class="docblock"><a name="multi_opac"></a><h3>multi_opac</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT multi_opac, multi_emiss, multi_srcf
  are the default names of the opacity, emissivity, and source function
  arrays in post-processing files.  By default, they are "opac",
  "emiss", and "srcf", respectively.  If none of these are present,
  drat_akap and drat_ekap will also be tried for the opacity and
  source function, respectively.  If emissivity is present, source
  function will be ignored.
  The units of opacity are inverse length, of emissivity power per
  photon energy per sterradian per volume, and source function
  power per photon energy per sterradian per area.</pre>

<div class="docblock"><a name="multi_streak"></a><h3>multi_streak</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT result= multi_streak(mf, rays, slimits, gb=common_bins)
  like the streak function, but allows opacity to be built up from
  "slave files", in addition to the "master file" MF(1).  The MF
  parameter is an array of MultiFiles, each created by multif.
  The master file MF(1) contains the mesh, and the master list of dump
  times.  Only dump times which are present in this master list, and
  in every slave file, will be processed.
  The master file MF(1) need not contain any opacity or emissivity data
  at all; each of the slave files MF(2:0) must contain data for at
  least one zone.

  The emissivities and opacities from each file are interpolated onto
  a common group structure.  This common group structure can be
  provided via the GB keyword to multi_streak.  If it is not provided,
  GB is computed by examining the group boundary (or center) arrays
  from the master and every slave file, and building a group structure
  which is at least as fine as every component group structure, at every
  point in the spectrum.

  Example:
    File family "prob_p00" contains the mesh and opacities and
    emissivities for all zones.  Family "pp_h00" contains post
    processed opacities and emissivities on a much finer spectral
    mesh, but only for zones in regions 1 and 2 of the original
    problem.  You want to transport the emission from the
    inner regions 1 and 2 through the overlying material:

      restore, openb("prob_p00"), ireg;
      master= multif("prob_p00", zoneuse=where(ireg>2));
      slave= multif("pp_h00", zonelist=where(ireg==1|ireg==2));
      rays= ...
      slimits= ...
      drat_start= ...

      result= multi_streak([master,slave], rays, slimits);

<div class="docblock"><a name="multi_streak_save"></a><h3>multi_streak_save</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT multi_streak_save, outname, mf, rays, slimits, gb=common_bins
      or multi_streak_save, outfile, mf, rays, slimits, gb=common_bins
  like the streak function, but allows opacity to be built up from
  "slave files", in addition to the "master file" MF(1) and 
  saves the streak in a PDB history file.  The MF parameter
  is an array of MultiFiles, each created by multif.
  The master file MF(1) contains the mesh, and the master list of dump
  times.  Only dump times which are present in this master list, and
  in every slave file, will be processed.
  The master file MF(1) need not contain any opacity or emissivity data
  at all; each of the slave files MF(2:0) must contain data for at
  least one zone.

  If the first argument is OUTFILE, a file variable instead of a
  file name, then that file is used for output.  You can create
  OUTFILE and add static variables to it with save (but do NOT call
  add_record) which streak_save otherwise wouldn't know about.

  The output file has history records at the same times as the
  input file.  Each record contains "time" (a double scalar),
  and the two arrays "transp", the transparency (between 0 and 1),
  and "selfem", the self emission (which has the same units as
  ekap in the file F).  The dimensions of transp and selfem
  are ngroup-by-2-by-nrays (where nrays represents zero or more
  dimensions, copied from the RAYS input array).  The RAYS and
  SLIMITS inputs are placed into the output file as non-record
  variables, and any variables in the drat_static option are
  copied form F to the output file.  The gb and gav variables
  are copied from F into the output file as well.  If the drat_glist
  option is present, that is stored in the output file also.

  The emissivities and opacities from each file are interpolated onto
  a common group structure.  This common group structure can be
  provided via the GB keyword to multi_streak.  If it is not provided,
  GB is computed by examining the group boundary (or center) arrays
  from the master and every slave file, and building a group structure
  which is at least as fine as every component group structure, at every
  point in the spectrum.

  Example:
    File family "prob_p00" contains the mesh and opacities and
    emissivities for all zones.  Family "pp_h00" contains post
    processed opacities and emissivities on a much finer spectral
    mesh, but only for zones in regions 1 and 2 of the original
    problem.  File "prob_strk" contains the streak history. 
    You want to transport the emission from the
    inner regions 1 and 2 through the overlying material:

      restore, openb("prob_p00"), ireg;
      master= multif("prob_p00", zoneuse=where(ireg>2));
      slave= multif("pp_h00", zonelist=where(ireg==1|ireg==2));
      fout= openb("prob_strk");
      save, fout, kmax, lmax;
      rays= ...
      slimits= ...
      drat_start= ...
      drat_stop= ...
      result= multi_streak_save(fout, [master,slave], rays, slimits);
      multic, master;
      multic, slave;

<div class="docblock"><a name="multi_times"></a><h3>multi_times</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT times= multi_times(mf)
  returns the list of times which will be used by multi_streak.  This
  is the subset of streak_times(mf(1)) which occur in all of the slave
  files.  The drat_start and drat_stop times work as usual.</pre>

<div class="docblock"><a name="multi_zonelist"></a><h3>multi_zonelist</h3>

</div>
<div class="docblock"><a name="_multi_bins"></a><h3>_multi_bins</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT gb= _multi_bins(nfinal, gb1, gb2, ...)
  returns NFINAL+1 boundaries of NFINAL bins constructed by combining
  the input bin structures GB1, GB2, etc.
  Use NFINAL=0 to get at least the resolution in the finest GBi in
  every region of the spectrum.

  This is done by constructing a total bin density function
  (#bins/energy width), as the maximum of the bin density of each
  component.  This total bin density function is integrated, and
  the integral is divided into NFINAL equal parts; the points in
  energy at which this division must be made are the returned bin
  boundaries.

  In the returned bin structure, the density of bins is everywhere
  proportional to the densest bins in any of the GBi.</pre>
  
</div>
<div class="docblock"><a name="_multi_integrate"></a><h3>_multi_integrate</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT atten_emit= _multi_integrate(f, mesh, time, irays, slimits)
  is the default drat_integrate routine.
  On entry, file F is positioned at TIME, from which MESH has already
  been read.  IRAYS and SLIMITS are the rays coordinates (in internal
  format) and integration limits.
  The result should be ngroup-by-2-by-raydims, where the second index
  is 1 for the attenuation factor, 2 for the self-emission (specific
  intensity due to emission along the ray).
