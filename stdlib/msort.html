  <pre>DOCUMENT msort(x1, x2, x3, ...)
  returns an index list which sorts the array X1 into increasing
  order.  Where X1 values are equal, the list will sort X2 into
  increasing order.  Where both X1 and X2 are equal, X3 will be
  in increasing order, and so on.  Finally, where all of the keys
  are equal, the returned list will leave the order unchanged
  from the input keys.

  The Xi may be numbers or strings (e.g.- X1 could be an integer
  while X2 was a string, and X3 was a real).  The Xi must all be
  conformable, and each dimension of X1 must be as large as the
  corresponding dimension of any otehr Xi.

  Hence, msort(x) will return the same list as sort(x), except
  where the values of x are equal, in which case msort leaves
  the order unchanged, while sort non-deterministically permutes
  equal elements.  This feature may cost a factor of two in speed,
  so don't use it unless you really need it.  In general, msort
  will call sort up to twice per input argument.

<div class="docblock"><a name="msort_rank"></a><h3>msort_rank</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT msort_rank(x)
         msort_rank(x, list)
  returns a list of longs the same size and shape as X, whose
  values are the "rank" of the corresponding element of X among
  all the elements of X -- the smallest element has rank 0 and
  the largest has the largest rank, which is equal to one less
  than the number of distinct values in the array X.

  If LIST is present, it is set to the order list returned by
  sort(x(*)).
