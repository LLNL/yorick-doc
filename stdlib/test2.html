      or test2, npass
  Given a slab divided into zones by parallel planes, and given a
  set of photon group boundary energies, compute the contribution of
  each zone to the radiation flux emerging from one surface of the
  slab.  If NPASS is given, the calculation is repeated that many
  times.  The zoning, photon group structure, opacities, and source
  functions are all computed arbitrarily, but the number of zones
  and groups are taken to be representative of a typical 1-D
  radiation transport calculation.</pre>
