<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p>You can download the current yorick source from github as a
<a href="http://github.com/dhmunro/yorick/tarball/master">tarball</a> or
<a href="http://github.com/dhmunro/yorick/zipball/master">zipball</a>.
You may also wish to build additional yorick plugin packages; see the
plugins listed on the
<a href="http://github.com/yorick/yorick.github.com/wiki"
target="_blank">Wiki</a>.
</p>
<p>Compile instructions are in the top level README file; on UNIX or
Mac platforms, a simple "make install" will configure and build
yorick.  On MS Windows, you can build a terminal-based yorick (like
the UNIX or Mac yorick) under <a href="http://www.mingw.org/"
target="_blank">MinGW</a> (or <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/"
target="_blank">Cygwin</a>) with a similar make command.  Currently,
building the GUI yorick on MS Windows requires that you have MFC
(Microsoft Foundation Classes), which is outdated and only present if
you purchased MS Visual C++.  The terminal yorick works equally
well, especially if you run it under emacs; yorick interactive
graphics windows work, and emacs gives you a place to type commands.
</p>
<h3>Binaries</h3>
<p>On Debian or Ubuntu Linux systems, you can simply install the
latest yorick Debian packages.
</p>
<p>There are some outdated binaries for other platforms at the yorick
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/yorick"
target="_blank">sourceforge</a> projects page.  We will post updated
binaries as they become available.  If you would like to maintain a
yorick binary for some platform, please contact dhmunro at
users.sourceforge.net.
