The files in this directory are the targets for the liquid template
engine's {%include filename%} tag.

doctype.html    - first line of all generated html pages
meta.html       - <meta> and <link> tags, ending with <body> tag
  - page heading and banner in _layouts/default.html
content.html    - <div> structure and main (right) column content
sidebar.html    - sidebar (left column) content
trailer.html    - </div> structure finishing content.html structure
  - awkward, sidebar.html should be included by content.html, but that
    would make it difficult to support alternate sidebar in layout
    - better solution would be to make variant of {%include %} that
      supported passing filename as a variable
footer.html     - footer content

package.html    - used by ydoc.pl to generate gh-pages/index.html
                  or stdlib/index.html
  - should contain description of the package
  - goes above section index, function index

sideqref.html   - quick reference sidebar template used by ydoc.pl
sideqrf.html, sideqri.html, sideqrl.html
  - automatically generated by ydoc.pl from sideqref.html template
