<p>The main yorick distribution includes many functions and packages
of functions, which are present in every yorick build.  (The exception
is the mpy package for parallel processing, which may not be
universally present.)  The documentation for these functions is available
via the interactive help command:<pre>
   help, symbol
</pre>
where symbol is any yorick variable or function.  Help prints the text
in a special document comment in the source code where the symbol was
defined.  Here is an automatically generated compendium of all such
document comments in the main yorick distribution.  The Plugins link
in the sidebar will take you to similar collections of document
comments for add-on yorick packages which are not part of the main
distribution.</p>
