<p>Here are links to documentation for open source yorick plugins and
packages which are not part of the main distribution.  These packages
add functionality to yorick; because they are open source, you can
use their source code as templates for creating your own extensions
to yorick.</p>

<p>To create documentation for your own package, clone the
<a href="http://github.com/dhmunro/yorick-doc"
target="_blank">yorick-doc</a> git repository, then run the ydoc.pl
git script on your yorick plugin tree.  If you publish your yorick-doc
generated website, you can add its URL to the following list in your
copy of the yorick-doc repo, and issue a pull request to have your
documentation appear here.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dhmunro.github.com/yorick-z"><em>yorick-z:</em></a>
