<h2>What is Yorick?</h2>

<p>Yorick is an interpreted programming language for scientific
simulations or calculations, postprocessing or steering large
simulation codes, interactive scientific graphics, and reading,
writing, or translating large files of numbers.  Yorick includes an
interactive graphics package, and a binary file package capable of
translating to and from the raw numeric formats of all modern
computers. Yorick is written in ANSI C and runs on most operating
systems (*nix systems, MacOS X, Windows).  For a short overview, see the
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2184">Linux Journal</a> 
and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080207173819/http://www.unixreview.com/documents/s=7750/uni1040141806673/">Unix review</a> articles.</p>

Features:
<ul>
<li>Open source, BSD license.</li>
<li>C-like syntax, but array operators make most loops unnecessary.
Matlab and IDL/PV-Wave are comparable commercial applications.</li>
<li>C API for writing dynamically linked compiled extensions.</li>
<li>Interactive scientific graphics, output to postscript.  Runs
ghostscript to convert to eps, png, or jpeg formats.</li>
<li>Emacs-based development environment.</li>
</ul>
