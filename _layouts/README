layout: default.html
  requires  headline:   page title (with "Yorick " prepended)
  optional  anchor:     '<a name=...>...</a>' only needed for User Manual
            prefix:     path/URL to css, images, manual, etc. directories
                          - default set in _config.yml

Derive alternate layouts by modifying default.html.  For example,
replace {{page.headline}} by a fixed title, or replace sidebar.html
with a custom sidebar (e.g.-qrfunc.html).

If you modify default.html, or create your own styles, beware that
ydoc.pl has a very limited jekyll emulator.  Only variable
substitution of {{page.varname}} or {{site.varname}} and the {%include
filename%} tag are supported, plus a hack to handle overriding the
site.prefix variable.  Additional support may be added in the future,
and you may not care if you use jekyll itself to test your site.

layout: qrfunc.html, qrio.html, qrlang.html
