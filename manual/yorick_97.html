<h2 class="section">4.1 Mechanics of embedding</h2>

<p>In the following discussion, I refer to three directories:
&lsquo;<tt>Y_SITE</tt>&rsquo; is the directory where the architecture independent
parts of Yorick reside; everything Yorick needs at runtime is here.
&lsquo;<tt>Y_HOME</tt>&rsquo; is the directory where the libraries and executables you
need to build custom versions are stored.  &lsquo;<tt>Y_LAUNCH</tt>&rsquo; is the
directory containing the executable for your version of Yorick.  When
you run Yorick, the names of all three directories are available as
variables; for example, start yorick and type <kbd>Y_HOME</kbd> to print
the name of that directory.  Also, I will only discuss the UNIX
program development environment; the same system works tolerably well
under the MinGW or Cygwin environments under Windows, which you can
use with the commerical MSVC++ compiler if you wish.
</p>
<p>The paradigm for a compiled extension to yorick is called a &ldquo;compiled
package&rdquo;.  The idea is that a compiled package should be
indistinguishable from an interpreted package (for example, a <kbd>.i</kbd>
file in the interpreted library that comes with the distribution).  In
the case of a purely interpreted package, you write an include file
defining your interface.  So, too, you must lay out the interpreted
interface for a compiled package in an interpreted include file, which
we call here &lsquo;<tt>mypkg.i</tt>&rsquo;.  Including &lsquo;<tt>mypkg.i</tt>&rsquo; makes the
compiled package available to the interpreter.
</p>
<p>The compiled package include file &lsquo;<tt>mypkg.i</tt>&rsquo; must contain one
statement, executed before any code that uses the compiled routines,
which distinguishes it from an interpreted package:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">plug_in, &quot;mypkg&quot;;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Here, we assume the package name is &ldquo;mypkg&rdquo;, matching the name of
the file &lsquo;<tt>mypkg.i</tt>&rsquo;, but you can choose any name for the package
you like.  In fact, you can have any number of include files defining
different pieces of the interface to a single compiled package, say
&lsquo;<tt>mypkg1.i</tt>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<tt>mypkg2.i</tt>&rsquo;, and so on, each of which would
contain the above <kbd>plug_in</kbd> call.  In a single compiled package
source directory, however, there can be at most one package name.  (If
you want to build more than one binary library, use more than one
directory to hold the source.)
</p>
<p>An alternative form is permitted to make it possible to design package
include files which are compatible with pre-version-1.6 yorick:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">if (!is_void(plug_in)) plug_in, &quot;mypkg&quot;;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Unlike an interpreted package, before you can use a compiled package,
you naturally need to compile it!  This is done using the UNIX make
utility.  Yorick has tools to assist in this build process.  The first
is the (interpreted) package <kbd>make.i</kbd> which generates, or at least
provides a starting point for, the &lsquo;<tt>Makefile</tt>&rsquo;, which is the input
to the make utility.  The second is <kbd>codger</kbd>, a (compiled) yorick
utility which generates the C source code that bridges between your
compiled code and yorick&rsquo;s internal compiled code.
</p>
<p>First, you need to put your C (and/or Fortran) source and header files
in the directory containing the &lsquo;<tt>mypkg.i</tt>&rsquo; interface definition
file(s).  Note that you need to design your C interface in an
&ldquo;interpreter friendly&rdquo; fashion.  For example, it is worthless to
write a special function that computes a special function at a single
point, because the interpreter would need to call it in a loop to
compute a vector of values, most likely erasing the entire advantage
of writing your special function in compiled code.  At the very least,
therefore, you want your compiled functions to accept a (potentially
long) list of inputs an produce the corresponding list of outputs.
</p>
<p>When all the <kbd>.i</kbd>, <kbd>.c</kbd>, and <kbd>.h</kbd> (and Fortran) source
files for your package have been collected in this package source
directory (and any unrelated source removed), execute the command
(in that directory):
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">yorick -batch make.i
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>This creates a &lsquo;<tt>Makefile</tt>&rsquo; for your package.  In simple cases,
this &lsquo;<tt>Makefile</tt>&rsquo; will be all you need to build your compiled
package; in more complicated situations, you will need to edit it by
hand to fill in critical information the &lsquo;<tt>make.i</tt>&rsquo; package is
unable to determine by its examination of the source files.
</p>
<p>The main reason you may need to edit &lsquo;<tt>Makefile</tt>&rsquo; by hand is to add
the loader flags (-l and -L) for dependencies, that is, third party
libraries, your compiled code calls.  You may also need to add
compiler flags (-I) to enable the compiler to find the header files
which declare the interfaces to such libraries.  The corresponding
macros in &lsquo;<tt>Makefile</tt>&rsquo; are <kbd>PKG_DEPLIBS</kbd> and <kbd>PKG_CFLAGS</kbd>,
respectively.  In general, if your package needs modifications like
this and you wish it to be buildable by non-experts, you will need to
modify &lsquo;<tt>Makefile</tt>&rsquo; to pick up the results of a configure script,
which you will need to design and write.  This can be far more
difficult than writing the compiled package in the first place.  The
message is, do not rely on dependent libraries other than libc, libm,
and the utilities in yorick&rsquo;s own &lsquo;<tt>play/</tt>&rsquo; portability layer if
you can possibly avoid it.
</p>
<p>Once you have the &lsquo;<tt>Makefile</tt>&rsquo;, use the make utility to actually
build your compiled package.  The &lsquo;<tt>Makefile</tt>&rsquo; invokes a more
extensive input file, &lsquo;<tt>Y_HOME/Makepkg</tt>&rsquo;, which provides a number
of useful &ldquo;targets&rdquo; you can build.  Here are several useful make
command lines; read &lsquo;<tt>Y_HOME/Makepkg</tt>&rsquo; to learn about others:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">make           # build release version
make install   # install it (may need to be root)
make debug     # build debuggable version
make clean     # delete all but source and Makefile
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>The release version of your package will be a dynamically loadable
yorick plugin, as long as yorick is able to handle plugins on your
platform.  The debuggable version, and the release version on
platforms which do not permit plugins, will be a complete yorick
executable, which statically loads your new package at startup.  (By
default, it will simply be called &ldquo;yorick&rdquo;, and installing such a
release version it will overwrite the yorick you used to run
<kbd>-batch make.i</kbd>, so be careful.)
</p>
<p>When you want to build your package on a different platform, you always
need to run:
</p><table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">yorick -batch make.i
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>before you rerun the make utility.
</p>
<p>In addition to the <kbd>plug_in</kbd> command, your &lsquo;<tt>mypkg.i</tt>&rsquo; package
interface file must contain statements that allow the <kbd>codger</kbd>
utility to construct the bridge code.  During the build process,
<kbd>codger</kbd> examines &lsquo;<tt>mypkg.i</tt>&rsquo; package, looking for interpreted
<kbd>extern</kbd> statements outside any function body.  For each such
<kbd>extern</kbd> statement, codger generates an interpreted built-in
function, or an interpreted pointer to compiled global data.  When the
interpreter includes the file, these statements are no-ops, except
that they may include DOCUMENT comments that are added to the
interactive <kbd>help</kbd> system.  The &lsquo;<tt>mypkg.i</tt>&rsquo; file will usually
also contain purely interpreted wrapper code for these compiled
objects, in order to create a high-quality interpreted API.
</p>
<p>For example, when <kbd>codger</kbd> finds this:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">extern my_func;
/* DOCUMENT my_func(input)
     returns the frobnostication of the array INPUT.
 */
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>in the &lsquo;<tt>mypkg.i</tt>&rsquo; file, it connects the interpreted symbol
<kbd>my_func</kbd> to a compiled function <kbd>Y_my_func</kbd> with a specific
prototype, which you are responsible for writing, as described in the
following section.
</p>
<p>Often you can avoid all these details; codger can generate
<kbd>Y_my_func</kbd> for you automatically.  To do this, put PROTOTYPE
comments in your startup include file:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">func my_func(input)
/* DOCUMENT my_func(input)
     returns the frobnostication of the array INPUT.
 */
{
  return my_func_raw(input, numberof(input));
}
extern my_func_raw;
/* PROTOTYPE
   double my_func_C_name(double array input, long length)
 */
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>This generates a wrapper for a C function which takes a single array as
input and returns a scalar result.  If the function had been Fortran,
it would have looked like this (Fortran passes all arguments by reference
&ndash; that is, as if they were arrays):
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">func my_func(input)
/* DOCUMENT my_func(input)
     returns the frobnostication of the array INPUT.
 */
{
  return my_func_raw(input, numberof(input));
}
extern my_func_raw;
/* PROTOTYPE FORTRAN
   double my_func_Fortran_name(double array input, long array length)
 */
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Legal data types for the function return result in the <kbd>PROTOTYPE</kbd>
comment are: void (i.e.- a subroutine), char, short, int, long, float,
or double.
</p>
<p>Legal data types for the function parameters in the <kbd>PROTOTYPE</kbd>
comment are: void (only if there are no other parameters), char, short,
int, long, float, double, string (char *, guaranteed 0-terminated), or
pointer (void *).  These may be followed by the word &quot;array&quot;, which
becomes &quot;*&quot; in the C source code, to indicate an array of that type.
The parameter name is optional.
</p>
<p>The <kbd>DOCUMENT</kbd> comment should start with <kbd>/* DOCUMENT</kbd>.  They
will be returned by the interpreted command <kbd>help, my_func</kbd>, and be
included in the poor- man&rsquo;s document produced by Yorick&rsquo;s &quot;mkdoc&quot;
command (see &lsquo;<tt>Y_HOME/i/mkdoc.i</tt>&rsquo;).
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">extern my_global;
reshape, my_global, datatype;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>attaches the interpreted variable <kbd>my_global</kbd> to a C-compiled global of
the same name, which has the data type <kbd>datatype</kbd> (this must have been
declared in a previous struct or be one of the primitive types).  If you
want <kbd>my_global</kbd> to be attached to a global variable of a different
name, use:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">extern my_global;
/* EXTERNAL my_global_C_name */
reshape, my_global, datatype;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>To attach to a Fortran common block, say
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">        double var1, var2, var3
        common /my_common/ var1, var2, var3
        save /my_common/
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>(note that this doesn&rsquo;t make sense unless the common block is saved outside
the scope of the functions in which it is used) use:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">struct my_common_type { double var1, var2, var3; }
extern my_common;
/* EXTERNAL FORTRAN my_common */
reshape, my_common, my_common_type;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>If you mix double, integer, and real data in a single common block, you
can ensure that you won&rsquo;t have any alignment difficulties by putting
all the doubles first, followed by integers and reals.  If you don&rsquo;t do
this, you&rsquo;re relying on the existence of a Fortran compiler switch which
forces proper data alignment &ndash; some machine someday won&rsquo;t have this.
</p>
<p>This covers all the things that <kbd>codger</kbd> can do for you.
</p>
<p>The primary goal of this system is portability.  The basic idea is
that all the platform specific problems can be solved once in the
&lsquo;<tt>Y_HOME/Makepkg</tt>&rsquo; file, so that you can easily move your compiled
packages from one platform to another.  With the advent of plugins,
this system also must cope with packages which are either statically
or dynamically loaded, and the same source code must work for either
case.  The secondary goal is that the final users should do nothing
different to use a compiled package than they would to use an
interpreted package.
